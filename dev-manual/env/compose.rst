==============
Docker Compose
==============

Linux containers and Docker have radically changed the way applications are
developed, built, distributed and deployed. The AtoM team is experimenting
with new workflows that make use of containers. This document introduces our
new development workflow based on Docker and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__.
The latter is a tool that help us to run multi-container applications like AtoM
and it is suitable for both development and production environments.

.. WARNING::

   The Docker Compose integration and AtoM Dockerfile outlined here are intended
   for **testing and development purposes only**. They have not been fully
   tested and prepared for use in production environments at this time.

   If you encounter issues or bugs, you are welcome to report them via the
   `AtoM users forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ica-atom-users>`__
   - we will provide basic support as we are able, but urge you to proceed at
   your own risk.

If this is the first time that you have heard about containers you may find
`The New Stack eBook Series <http://thenewstack.io/ebookseries/>`_ a useful
resource to get up to speed quickly.

Install Docker and Docker Compose
=================================

Docker works the same whether you are using `Docker for Windows
<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/>`_, `Docker for Mac
<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/>`_ or Docker on Linux. For the latter,
make sure that both `Docker Engine
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_ and `Docker Compose
<https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_  are installed following the
instructions in the links.

Spin it up
==========

Let's make sure that the Docker client can reach the engine. The following
command will list the currently running containers:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker ps

Now using git, check out the sources of AtoM and change your current directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone -b qa/2.x https://github.com/artefactual/atom.git atom
   cd atom

.. note::

   The source code (the entire "atom" folder) is copied to the Docker container
   on the build process and used to create the instance. For example, clone the
   "stable/|version|.x" branch if you want to test the latest stable version of AtoM.

Now set the environment variable ``COMPOSE_FILE`` to tell Compose what is the
location of our YAML file. You could do the same using the ``-f`` flag but we
don't want to do so each time we invoke the ``docker-compose`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

   # For bash users (most of you)
   export COMPOSE_FILE="$PWD/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml"

   # For fish users
   set -lx COMPOSE_FILE (pwd)/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml

It's time to use Docker Compose in order to provision our containers:

.. IMPORTANT::

   In some operating systems, the default virtual memory limits can be low.
   Elasticsearch increases one of those limits when installed via packages and
   in the container that will be created below. However, the same limit needs
   to be increased in the host running this environment. Check the
   `Elasticsearch documentation
   <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/vm-max-map-count.html>`__
   for more information.

   The containers for the application use ``php:7.4-fpm-alpine`` as their base
   image. If an old version of this image has been already downloaded by the
   Docker engine in the host, run ``docker pull php:7.4-fpm-alpine`` to get the
   latest version before creating the containers. It has to be based on Alpine
   v3.8 or higher to be able to install some packages.

.. note::

   To enable LDAP Authentication with docker, jump to :ref:`Enable LDAP Authentication
   with Docker <ldap-auth-docker>`.


.. code-block:: bash

   # Create and start containers. This may take a while the first time you run
   # it because all the images have to be downloaded (e.g. percona, memcached)
   # and the AtoM image has to be built.
   docker-compose up -d

All seven docker containers should now be up and running.

.. IMPORTANT::

   If the atom container command below to purge the database fails with the
   message: ``PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted
   ...``,  you can increase the memory allocated  by either adding the line
   ``ATOM_PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=1G`` to the file ``docker/etc/environment``
   or alternatively run the command without memory limits
   ``docker-compose exec atom php -d memory_limit=-1 symfony tools:purge --demo``


.. code-block:: bash

   # Execute a command in the running container atom: purge database
   docker-compose exec atom php symfony tools:purge --demo

   # Execute another command: build stylesheets
   docker-compose exec atom make -C plugins/arDominionPlugin

.. TIP::

   While you wait, take the opportunity to check out our `Dockerfile <https://github.com/artefactual/atom/blob/qa/2.x/Dockerfile>`__,
   which describes the steps that are taken to build the AtoM image. It is
   based on Alpine Linux + PHP 7.4 and the rest of dependencies. In addition,
   our `docker-compose.dev.yml <https://github.com/artefactual/atom/blob/qa/2.x/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml>`__
   file shows how AtoM is orchestrated together with its service dependencies.
   It is an environment meant to be used by developers.

That's it! You have started the containers and put them in the background,
populated the database and initiated the Elasticsearch index. You can start
developing right away. Changes made in the source code will take effect
immediately.

Due to a bug that has not been solved yet, the AtoM worker needs to be
restarted after the database is populated for the first time:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose restart atom_worker

.. IMPORTANT::

   To avoid resetting the configuration files to their default version each time
   the containers are created, the following files are only generated if they
   don't exist already in the source code:

   - apps/qubit/config/app.yml
   - apps/qubit/config/factories.yml
   - apps/qubit/config/settings.yml

Docker Compose lets you perform many different actions. Please refer to the
`documentation <https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/>`_ for more help.
For example, you can monitor the output of some of your containers as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose logs -f atom atom_worker nginx

You can also scale the AtoM worker as needed:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose up -d --scale atom_worker=2

Let's verify that two workers have subscribed to Gearman:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Establish a TCP connection to gearmand, port 4730
   docker-compose exec atom bash -c "nc gearmand 4730"

   # Send STATUS command

You could temporarily stop all the services with ``docker-compose stop`` (which
will need ``docker-compose up -d`` later to start the services again) or both
stop and remove related containers, network and volumes by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose down --volumes

.. _ldap-auth-docker:

Enable LDAP Authentication with Docker
======================================

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create and start containers. This may take a while the first time you run
   # it because all the images have to be downloaded (e.g. percona, memcached)
   # and the AtoM image has to be built.
   #
   # Launch AtoM with auth-network for openldap container.
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker/docker-compose.auth-network.yml up -d

There should be seven docker containers running, and getting the following warning
message is normal: ``WARNING: Some networks were defined but are not used by any
service: auth-network``

Check that auth-network exists by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker network ls

To get the host IP of your openldap container from ``auth-network``, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker inspect auth-network

You should see a container named ``openldap_openldap_1`` with an ``IPv4Address`` value. This
value will be used as the Host value in your LDAP authentication settings page.
For more information on enabling LDAP Authentication, see :ref:`Enable LDAP Authentiation <ldap-enabling>`.

.. note::

   If you make changes to ``config/factories.yml`` after starting docker, you will
   need to restart your ``atom_worker`` container by running ``docker compose restart
   atom_worker`` for changes to take place.

Connect to AtoM
===============

You can run the following command to check the status and other information
about the containers:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker-compose ps

            Name                       Command               State                  Ports
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   docker_atom_1            /atom/src/docker/entrypoin ...   Up      9000/tcp
   docker_atom_worker_1     /atom/src/docker/entrypoin ...   Up      9000/tcp
   docker_nginx_1           nginx -g daemon off;             Up      0.0.0.0:63001->80/tcp
   docker_elasticsearch_1   /bin/bash bin/es-docker          Up      127.0.0.1:63002->9200/tcp, 9300/tcp
   docker_percona_1         /docker-entrypoint.sh mysqld     Up      127.0.0.1:63003->3306/tcp
   docker_memcached_1       docker-entrypoint.sh -p 11 ...   Up      127.0.0.1:63004->11211/tcp
   docker_gearmand_1        docker-entrypoint.sh gearmand    Up      127.0.0.1:63005->4730/tcp

As you can see in the right column:

* AtoM and its worker share port 9000, only in the containers network.
* Nginx is accessible in port 63001 from the host and from outside (if the host allows it).
* Elasticsearch can be accessed through port 63002, only from the host.
* Percona (MySQL) can be accessed through port 63003, only from the host.
* Memcached can be accessed through port 63004, only from the host.
* The Gearman server can be accessed through port 63005, only from the host.

.. image:: images/atom-docker-env.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: A representation of the AtoM Docker containers and ports

AtoM should be now accessible from your browser. To connect from the host, use
the following address: http://localhost:63001.

The default login details are:

* Username: ``demo@example.com``
* Password: ``demo``

Monitoring
==========

Extending the development environment, you can deploy an instance of
[Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management)
configured by default to collect metrics and query analytics data from the
MySQL server. To setup the PMM server and client services alongside all the
others you'll need to indicate two Docker Compose files on the ``COMPOSE_FILE``
environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   export COMPOSE_FILE="$PWD/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml:$PWD/docker/docker-compose.pmm.yml"

Unless it has been changed with the ``COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR`` environment
variable, on Linux and macOS the separator is ``:``, on Windows it is ``;``.

.. TIP::

   In some cases the ``pmm_client`` service fails to start reporting the
   following error:

   .. code-block:: bash

      [main] app already is running, exiting

   You'll need to fully recreate the container to make it work:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose rm pmm_client
      docker-compose up -d

To access the PMM server interface, visit http://localhost:63006:

* Username: ``pmm``
* Password: ``pmm``

Varnish Cache
=============

The development environment can also be extended with a `Varnish Cache
<https://varnish-cache.org/>`__ container installed in front of Nginx.
It's configured to cache all and ignore cookies to simulate a read-only
public site, and therefore authentication doesn't work.

.. code-block:: bash

   export COMPOSE_FILE="$PWD/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml:$PWD/docker/docker-compose.varnish.yml"
   docker-compose up -d

To access AtoM through Varnish, visit http://localhost:63007.

.. TIP::

   To see the Varnish logs use:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose exec varnish varnishlog
