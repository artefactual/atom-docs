# AtoM documentation

[Access to Memory](https://www.accesstomemory.org/) is a web-based, open source
application for standards-based archival description and access in a
multilingual, multi-repository environment.  Our target users are archivists,
librarians, and anyone working to describe and provide access to archival
material. This repository holds the documentation for the AtoM project,
including the User, Administrator, and Developer Manuals.

## About the AtoM docs

The AtoM documentation can be found on the Access to Memory website, at:

* https://www.accesstomemory.org/docs

We version the documentation for each major AtoM release. The docs are written
in reStructured Text
([reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)),
and generated using the [Sphinx documentation
generator](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/). Learn more about our documentation here:
