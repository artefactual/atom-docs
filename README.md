# AtoM documentation

[Access to Memory](https://www.accesstomemory.org/) is a web-based, open source application for standards-based archival description and access in a multilingual, multi-repository environment.
Our target users are archivists, librarians, and anyone working to describe and provide access to archival material. This repository holds the documentation for the AtoM project, including the User, Administrator, and Developer Manuals. 

## About the AtoM docs

The AtoM documentation can be found on the Access to Memory website, at:

We version the documentation for each major AtoM release. The docs are written in reStructured Text  ([reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)), and generated using the [Sphinx documentation generator](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
