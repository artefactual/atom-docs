Windows
=======

Every single piece of software
:ref:`required by AtoM <installation-requirements>` is compatible with Windows.
However, you should know that the process may not be straightforward at all if
you are not familiar with server environments under the Windows platform.

Artefactual does not test installations on non-Ubuntu platforms, so we are only
able to offer limited support - we suggest trying to coordinate with other users
via our `User forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ica-atom-users>`__.
We've tried to provide a few suggestions below to get you started.


Virtualizing Linux
==================

We strongly believe that Linux is the best choice for installing AtoM, but if
for whatever reason you are unable to switch to a different platform, you may
want to consider running a
`virtualized <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization>`__ Linux instance
in Windows. Some of the most popular virtualization tools in Windows are:

* VirtualBox (open source): https://www.virtualbox.org/
* VMware: http://www.vmware.com/
* Hyper-V (the official Windows hypervisor):
  http://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v-server

You should be able to use a virtual appliance in the virtualization tool of
your choice. However, Artefactual does **not** maintain production-ready virtual
appliances - so you will need an experienced technical administrator to help you
create and configure one if that is the approach you'd like to take. We do
provide a :ref:`Vagrant box <dev-env-vagrant>` for developers and users
interested in testing AtoM on their laptops, but the Vagrant box is not intended
for production use!

    * :ref:`dev-env-vagrant`

If you intend to continue using Windows, please proceed by following the
instructions provided below. Be warned that installing AtoM in a Windows
environment can be tricky, however, so be prepared for some hassle!

Web servers
===========

The good news is that the support of PHP in `IIS <http://www.iis.net/>`__ 7 or
above is excellent. Check out the official website: http://php.iis.net.

You can also use `Apache <https://httpd.apache.org/>`__ or
`Nginx <http://nginx.com/>`__;  we have tried both and had success with
Windows configurations.

There is also the option of using `WampServer <http://www.wampserver.com/>`_ or
`XAMPP <http://www.apachefriends.org/>`_, two software stacks that provide you
with all the packages that you need in order to run AtoM out of the box:
MySQL, Apache and PHP. It's definitely a very good option for inexperienced
users.


Elasticsearch
=============

You can run Elasticsearch in Windows as long as you can install Java.
`Download <http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/>`_ the latest
version available and run :command:`bin/elasticsearch.bat` in the Windows
Terminal.
