Firewall
========

It's not in the scope of this document to cover a complex firewall configuration
for your network. Instead, we are just going to show the easiest way to setup
a basic firewall for your web server in order to accept connections to your web
server and block incoming traffic targetting other services.

Ubuntu provides a simple firewall configuration tool called
`ufw <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall>`_ which we are going to use
here. Let's make sure that ufw is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install ufw

Accept connections to HTTP, HTTPS (SSL):

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

Allow access to your SSH server:

.. code-block:: bash

   # From any IP
   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

   # From a specific IP
   sudo ufw allow from 1.2.3.4 to any port 22 proto tcp

You are ready to go!

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ufw enable

Any change will persist even if you restart the machine.
