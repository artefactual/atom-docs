Tuning server parameters
========================

If you are looking for methods to improve the performance of AtoM and your
deployment, you are now in the right place!

First of all, most common performance issues could be solved by redesigning the
code, and that's something that we are working on constantly. But there's no
doubt that some configuration tweaks in your servers can give you better
results.

This page describes the most common performance tweaks


PHP opcode cache
================

PHP is an interpreted language. Each time a client requests a PHP page, the
server will read the source code and compile it before it's executed! APC is one
of the solutions available out ther that caches the compiled output of each PHP
script in order to save CPU cycles in subsequent requests.

Deploying APC is really easy:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install php-apc

We consider this component so important that it's listed as a mandatory
extension under :ref:`installation-requirements`. Really, don't ignore this.
Compiling the same source code again and again in a per-request basis is a huge
waste of time.

In addition, there is one particular directive in APC that you should tweak to
get the best performance: ``apc.stat``, enabled by default, this directive
forces APC to check the PHP scripts on each request to determine if they have
been modified. That's may happen frequently in development environments, but in
production you don't really need this. When you are upgrading AtoM, just restart
the PHP pool and the APC cache will be flushed.

.. note::

   APC has not been ported to PHP 5.5. Instead, Zend has contributed their Zend
   Optimizer+ opcode cache (OPcache). However, user-data cache is not something
   that OPcache implements, so if you are planning to use PHP 5.5 please look at
   APCu as a valid replacement for user-land caching, which emulates its
   functionality while providing the same API.


Other components that can be tweaked
====================================

This document is work in progress. We are planning to describe more tweaking
options in at least the following components:

* MySQL
* Nginx
* PHP-FPM
* Linux
* Caching proxy servers (HTTP accelerators)
* etc...
