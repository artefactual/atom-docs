Troubleshooting
===============

If you're running into issues with your AtoM installation, there are several
maintenance actions and command-line tasks you might want to try using to see
if they resolve the issue, prior to seeking external support. This page will
outline some of the most common issues, and how to resolve them.

.. TIP::

   If you are new to working with the Unix command-line, you might find the
   following slide deck useful to get started:

   * :ref:`maintenance-data-backup`

.. _troubleshooting-first-steps:

Figure out the nature of the problem
====================================

The first thing you should do is try to isolate exactly what is causing the issue.
Specifically:

* What are the exact steps required to reproduce this issue?
* What is the error encountered?
* What is the expected outcome?

Being able to articulate these clearly will often help you figure out what
solutions you should try first - and if you can't resolve the issue, you'll
need this information to seek further support.

It's also useful to try to rule out any factors that are unrelated to the issue.
For example: can you reproduce the error using a different browser? What about a
different computer? If your AtoM site is publicly accessible, does it behave
differently if accessed from home as opposed to work (i.e. might firewalls, VPNs,
or other restrictions be affecting your access)? Is the issue particular to a
specific user or group, or does it affect all users? If it's an error related to
a task supported by the job scheduler, is it just this one task that isn't working,
or are all jobs failing? And so forth.

With a detailed step-by-step guide to reproducing the issue, we can now better
diagnose the problem and consider what we can try to resolve it.

.. _troubleshooting-logs-debug:

Error logs and Debug mode
=========================

It can be useful to see if there is further information available on the nature
of the error in your webserver logs, particularly if you have encountered a
500 internal server error:

.. image:: images/500-error.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: An image of a 500 internal server error message in AtoM

For information on accessing the webserver logs, see:

* :ref:`maintenance-webserver`

Another thing you can try to collect more information on the nature of the error
is to see if a `stack trace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace>`__ is
available. This is particularly useful if the error results in a blank screen.

To check, you can try putting the application into **Debug mode**. More
information on how to use Debug mode can be found here:

* :ref:`debug-mode`

.. TIP::

   We also have a command-line tutorial video that will walk you through how to
   enable Debug mode and check your Nginx error logs, available here:

   * https://youtu.be/_zdplmuvhf0

   **Note:** The commands used in this video for restarting PHP-FPM is for
   Ubuntu 14.04 with PHP 5.x, which is no longer supported after version 2.4. 
   For more recent instructions on restarting PHP-FPM, see below: 

   * :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm`

:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-troubleshooting>`

.. _troubleshooting-restart-services:

Restarting services
===================

AtoM makes use of several PHP extensions, services, and libraries that are used
to support the functionality of the application. These are not managed directly
by AtoM or Symfony, and their use and location will depend on your particular
installation environment. The following commands assume you have followed our
:ref:`recommended installation instructions <installation-ubuntu>` - if you have
made changes, some of the commands may be different in your installation.

Restarting services can be a useful first step in trying to resolve issues - if
the service is in a bad state as a result of an error that has occurred, then
restarting it can often return it to a working condition. Below are basic
instructions for restarting PHP-FPM, Memcached, Nginx, and the atom-worker.

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-nginx`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-memcached`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-job-scheduler`

.. _troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm:

Restarting PHP-FPM
------------------

**What**

PHP-FPM is a PHP extension that allows for better interaction with an
applicationâ€™s web server, via the use and configuration of FastCGI pools in
PHP. In AtoM's default installation configuration, Nginx will proxy PHP requests
to PHP-FPM.

FastCGI is a binary protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web
server. FastCGI is a variation on the earlier Common Gateway Interface (CGI);
FastCGI's main aim is to reduce the overhead associated with interfacing the
web server and CGI programs, allowing a server to handle more web page
requests at once.

.. SEEALSO::

   * https://php-fpm.org/about/
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI

**When**

You should consider restarting PHP-FPM if:

* You have made any changes to your web server configuration
* You have made any changes to AtoM's :ref:`configuration files <customization-config-files>`
* You have made any changes to the PHP pool set up during installation
* You are trying to ensure all application caches are cleared

**How**

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`
   * :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-memcached`

.. _troubleshooting-restart-nginx:

Restarting Nginx
----------------

**What**

Nginx (pronounced "engine x") is an open source HTTP web server (among other
things). It manages the interaction between your web browser and AtoM. Your
browser requests a page in AtoM, and this is sent to Nginx, which communicates
with AtoM to retrieve and serve the page, or else returns an error message.

.. SEEALSO::

   * http://nginx.org/en/
   * https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx

**When**

You should consider restarting Nginx if:

* You've made changes to your web server configuration

**How**

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl reload nginx

.. _troubleshooting-restart-memcached:

Restarting memcached
--------------------

**What**

Memcached is an open-source, general purpose distributed memory object caching
system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by
caching data and objects in memory to reduce the number of times an external
data source (such as a database) must be read.

.. SEEALSO::

   * https://www.memcached.org/

**when**

You should consider restarting Memcached if you're using it when:

* You are trying to ensure all application caches are cleared

**How**

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl restart memcached

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`
   * :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm`


.. _troubleshooting-restart-job-scheduler:

Restarting the Job scheduler
----------------------------

**What**

AtoM relies on a job scheduler in order to execute certain long-running tasks
asynchronously in the background (instead of synchronously via your web
browser, making you wait until the task is done and the page loaded before
continuing), to guarantee that web requests are handled promptly and work
loads can be distributed across multiple machines. Example tasks in AtoM that
use the job scheduler include:

* :ref:`Generating finding aids <print-finding-aids>`
* :ref:`Importing records <import-export>` via the user interface
* :ref:`Exporting records <import-export>` via the Clipboard
* Using the :ref:`Move module <move-archival-description>` to reorganize
  :term:`archival description` hierarchies
* :ref:`Ingesting DIPs from Archivematica <archivematica:upload-atom>`

We use Gearman as our job scheduler in AtoM. Gearman "*provides a generic
application framework to farm out work to other machines or processes that are
better suited to do the work. It allows you to do work in parallel, to load
balance processing, and to call functions between languages.*"

.. SEEALSO::

   * http://gearman.org/
   * :ref:`installation-ubuntu-serve-workers`
   * :ref:`maintenance-asynchronous-jobs`
   * :ref:`manage-jobs`

**When**

You should consider restarting the atom-worker if:

* You have encountered a 500 error related to a task in AtoM supported by the
  job scheduler
* You have made changes to the worker configuration
* You have a job that never seems to complete in the queue

**How**

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl restart atom-worker

.. TIP::

   If the worker hits the start rate limit (3 starts in 24h) to be able to start
   it again after fixing the issue, the failed status has to be cleared:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl reset-failed atom-worker
      sudo systemctl start atom-worker   

Also, if you have multiple jobs that never seem to complete stuck in the
queue, you may also want to kill the queue itself, and then restart the
atom-worker. The following task will clear **all jobs** from the queue
(including those currently running, so be careful), as well as clear the job 
history of previous jobs from the database. This means you will need to manually 
restart any jobs you would like to continue via the AtoM :term:`user interface` 
after running this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony jobs:clear

.. TIP:: 

   A system administrator can also use SQL to kill just a specific stalled job, 
   if you don't want to lose other jobs in the queue, and/or the job history. 
   For more information, see: 

   * :ref:`sql-kill-job`

Other useful commands for managing the AtoM worker: 

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl enable atom-worker   # Enables the worker (on boot)
   sudo systemctl start atom-worker    # Starts the worker
   sudo systemctl stop atom-worker     # Stops the worker
   sudo systemctl status atom-worker   # Obtains current status

For more detailed information on managing the job scheduler and the 
``atom-worker``, see: 

* :ref:`maintenance-asynchronous-jobs`

:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-troubleshooting>`

.. _troubleshooting-resources-limits:

Monitoring active processes and checking execution limits
=========================================================

In some cases, your errors may be caused by a lack of resources - CPU, disk
space, and/or memory - or because you've encountered the limits imposed by your
PHP configuration. If this is the case, you might need to make changes to the
PHP pool configuration or allocate more resources to your server.

.. _troubleshooting-htop:

Monitoring active processes with htop
-------------------------------------

Before we make any changes, it can be useful to do some basic monitoring - is
this a temporary spike, or an ongoing issue? Can you reproduce the issue while
monitoring resource usage and see any correlation?


If you're familiar with the ``top`` command in Linux, this can be a useful way
to quickly view all active processes. However, we find ``htop`` to be a slightly
more user-friendly version of this.  You can use Ubuntu's package manager to
install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install htop

To launch htop in your terminal simply enter ``htop``. The console will display
a text-mode graph of your CPU, memory, and swap usage at the top of the page,
with a detailed list of processes provided below. This should give you a better
sense of whether or not you have enough resources allocated to your AtoM server.
It can also be useful to try to reproduce the error(s) you are encountering
while monitoring.

.. image:: images/htop.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: An image of htop running in the console

:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-troubleshooting>`

.. _troubleshooting-execution-limits:

Adjusting PHP execution limits
------------------------------

PHP includes several execution limits which are either configured during
AtoM's installation, or are set as defaults when PHP is installed. If you've
encountered an error, and the web server :ref:`error log <troubleshooting-logs-debug>`
includes a message like:

.. code-block:: none

   Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 60 seconds exceeded in ...

or:

.. code-block:: none

   Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 67108864 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 233734 bytes) in ...

...then you might want to consider changing PHP's execution limits. For more
information, see:

* :ref:`installation-execution-limits`

.. IMPORTANT:: 

   Some PHP settings are configured in the PHP pool set up during installation, 
   and should be adjusted there. See for example: 

   * :ref:`Ubuntu 20.04 PHP-FPM pool setup <installation-ubuntu-serve-php-fpm>`

Remember, if you make any changes to your PHP settings (either in the ``php.ini``
file, or in your application PHP pool), you will need to restart PHP-FPM after
saving your changes. See: 

* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm`

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`faq-504-error`

:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-troubleshooting>`

.. _troubleshooting-maintenance-tasks:

Running AtoM's most common maintenance tasks
============================================

A great deal of issues in AtoM can be resolved by running some of the most common
command-line and maintenance tasks included in the application. Some brief
details on each, and when you might want to use them, are included below.

.. SEEALSO::

   There are many other useful command-line tasks in AtoM that can also be
   useful during troubleshooting. For detailed information on each task, see:

   * :ref:`maintenance-cli-tools`

   Prefer to see this information in a slide deck? Check out:

   * https://www.slideshare.net/accesstomemory/atoms-command-line-tasks-an-introduction

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`troubleshooting-search-status`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-search-index`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-clear-cache`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-nested-set`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-slugs`

.. _troubleshooting-search-status:

Get information about your search index
---------------------------------------

**What**

AtoM maintains an Elasticsearch search index to provide fast, full-text search
results with faceting. It is this index that allows AtoM to find and display
records in the user interface when browsing and searching. During the 
installation process, we need to configure the host, port, and index name to be 
used in AtoM. Once records have been added to AtoM, they are indexed by 
Elasticsearch to aid in discovery via the user interface. 

This task will allow a system administrator to review the status of AtoM's
Elasticsearch index without having to access any configuration files. The task
output will include: 

* Elasticsearch version
* Search host
* Port
* Index name
* Document index status for all primary :term:`entity` types in AtoM (including 
  Accession, Actor, AIP, Function, Information object, Repository, and Term)

**When**

You might consider running this task if:

* Records seem to be missing from the user interface
* No records are showing in search or browse at all
* You are having trouble connecting to the search index
* You are seeking support and you suspect the issue might be search index related

**Basic usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony search:status

For more information, see: :ref:`cli-search-status`

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`maintenance-elasticsearch`
   * :ref:`faq-search-pop-warning`

.. _troubleshooting-search-index:

Populating the search index
---------------------------

**What**

AtoM maintains an Elasticsearch search index to provide fast, full-text search
results with faceting. It is this index that allows AtoM to find and display
records in the user interface when browsing and searching.

Running this task will delete the current index, then repopulate and optimize
the index. Depending on the number of records in your installation, this can
take a while to run - for production sites, we recommend running this task
after regular business hours.

.. TIP::

   If you don't need to re-index all :term:`entity types <entity>`, you
   might want to try using the task's ``--exclude-types`` option. See the full
   task documentation for more details:

   * :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`

**When**

You might consider re-populating the search index if:

* Records seem to be missing from the user interface
* No records are showing in search or browse at all
* You have recently imported records from the command-line
* You have :ref:`added a new language <add-remove-languages>` via the user
  interface Admin settings
* You have tried to perform an operation via the user interface that lead to a
  timeout

**Basic usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony search:populate

For more information and additional options, see: 

* :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`

.. TIP::

   Do you keep getting warnings in the console when running the ``search:populate``
   command? If so, you may have to resolve some data corruption issues first.
   See below, :ref:`troubleshooting-data-corruption`.

.. _troubleshooting-clear-cache:

Clearing the application cache
------------------------------

**What**

The Symfony 1.x framework that AtoM is built upon includes the ability to
cache HTML content, for better responsiveness to HTTP requests.

  *One of the ways to speed up an application is to store chunks of generated
  HTML code, or even full pages, for future requests. This technique is known as
  caching, and it can be managed on the server side and on the client side.*

  *...The principle of HTML caching is simple: Part or all of the HTML code that
  is sent to a user upon a request can be reused for a similar request. This
  HTML code is stored in a special place (the cache/ folder in symfony), where
  the front controller will look for it before executing an action. If a cached
  version is found, it is sent without executing the action, thus greatly
  speeding up the process. If no cached version is found, the action is
  executed, and its result (the view) is stored in the cache folder for future
  requests."*

From the
`Symfony docs <http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/gentle-introduction/1_4/en/12-Caching>`__

Occasionally, when errors occur or changes have been made, we need to flush
the cached HTML so we are being served updated content, and not an outdated
version of a web page. Running the ``cache:clear`` command will empty out the
existing application cache so it will become repopulated overtime with updated
versions of the web pages in AtoM as they are served to you.

**When**

You might want to try clearing the application cache if:

* You have made changes to AtoM's :ref:`configuration files <customization-config-files>`
* You have recently encountered an error, and are testing to see if it's resolved
* You are seeing something outdated or unexpected in the user interface
* You want to ensure you are seeing the current version of a page
* You have gotten a blank screen error that mysteriously works fine when the
  application is in :ref:`debug-mode`

.. NOTE::

   Because AtoM is session based, clearing the web browser cache might log you
   out of the application. Be sure you have saved any work you are doing in
   the user interface saved before doing so.

**Basic usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony cc

For more information, see: :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`

.. IMPORTANT::

   There are also other caches to consider clearing!

   PHP-FPM (a PHP extension that AtoM uses) can also cache some content - if you
   are clearing the application cache, you should also consider restarting
   PHP-FPM. See above:

   * :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm`

   Memcached is also an external cache engine that can be used with AtoM - you
   should restart it as well. See above:

   * :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-memcached`

   Finally, donâ€™t forget that **your web browser has its own cache** - in some
   cases, if you are not seeing changes take affect, you might want to try
   clearing your web browser cache. Note that, because AtoM is session based,
   clearing the web browser cache might log you out of the application. Be sure
   you have saved any work you are doing in the user interface before doing so.

.. _troubleshooting-nested-set:

Rebuilding the nested set
-------------------------

**What**

AtoM generally uses a relational database to store its data (generally,
MySQL). However, relational databases, which are comprised of flat tables, are
not particularly suited to handling hierarchical data.

As developer `Mike Hillyer <http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/>`__
notes, "Hierarchical data has a parent-child relationship that is not naturally
represented in a relational database table." One method of addressing this is to
employ a "Nested set model" (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model>`__).

AtoM makes use of a nested set to manage hierarchical relationships, such as
between parent and child terms and descriptions. Sometimes, during operations
that involve updates to large hierarchies, the nested set can become corrupted
- especially if the server times out during an operation that reaches the
:ref:`execution limit <installation-execution-limits>` settings. This task will
rebuild all nested sets in AtoM.

**When**

You might consider rebuilding the nested set if:

* You are seeing strange behavior and/or missing records in the :term:`treeview`
* You have attempted a long-running task that has timed out, causing it to fail
  midway
* You have gotten a 500 error, and the web server logs include something like:
  ``Parent Resource id: 'XXXXX' does not exist``

**Basic usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony propel:build-nested-set

For more information, see: :ref:`cli-rebuild-nested-set`

.. IMPORTANT::

   You should also run the ``search:populate`` task to re-index your site 
   after rebuilding the nested set. For more information and task options, see:

   * :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`


.. _troubleshooting-slugs:

Generating slugs
----------------

**What**

A slug is a word or sequence of words which make up the last part of a URL in
AtoM. It is the part of the URL that uniquely identifies the resource and
often is indicative of the name or title of the page (e.g.: in
``www.yourwebpage.com/about``, the slug is ``about``). The slug is meant to
provide a unique, human-readable, permanent link to a resource. You can read
more about slugs in AtoM here: :ref:`slugs-in-atom`.

In some cases, AtoM may time out in the middle of an operation that involves
the creation of new records. In such cases, it is possible that AtoM has died
after creating an :term:`information object`, but before having a chance to
create a slug for the record. This can cause unexpected errors in the
application - most notably, 500 errors when trying to access the records
missing slugs through the application interface. This task will generate new
slugs for any that are missing them in the database.

**When**

You might want to try re-generating slugs if:

* You have timed out while attempting an operation that creates new records, such
  as an import, or saving a large description
* You have gotten an error or warning while trying to
  :ref:`populate the search index <troubleshooting-search-index>` with a message
  that includes something like: "*Couldn't find information object (id: XXXXX)*"
* You suspect the error you've encountered may be due to
  :ref:`data corruption <troubleshooting-data-corruption>`
* You have made changes to the description
  :ref:`permalink settings <description-permalinks>` and want to update existing
  slugs to match these settings

**Basic usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony propel:generate-slugs

For more information, see: :ref:`cli-generate-slugs`

.. IMPORTANT::

   You should also run the ``search:populate`` task to re-index your site 
   after generating slugs. For more information and task options, see:

   * :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`

:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-troubleshooting>`

.. _troubleshooting-data-corruption:

Dealing with data corruption
============================

Data corruption refers to errors in computer data that occur during writing,
reading, storage, transmission, or processing, which introduce unintended
changes to the original data. In AtoM, this often means missing or incorrect
values written to the MySQL database when a transaction fails to complete.
Depending on the nature of the corruption, this can sometimes exist in your
data for a long time before causing any noticeable issues.

Data corruption can happen in AtoM when large operations are aborted
mid-process - for example, attempting a large
:ref:`move <move-archival-description>`,
:ref:`publication status update <publish-archival-description>`,
or :ref:`import <import-export>` via the web-based :term:`user interface`, and
having it time out before the task completes. As of AtoM 2.3, database
transaction support in MySQL was added to AtoM, which *should* reduce the
likelihood of corruption - if an operation times out, then the database should
automatically roll back to the last known good state. However, if you continue
to experience errors in AtoM and have attempted many of the steps above without
result, then it's possible that you've encountered some corrupt data, and will
need to perform some manual checks and fixes to address it.

Data corruption can occur in any :term:`entity type <entity>` in AtoM, but it
seems to occur most frequently among :term:`information object` data - AKA
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, likely due to the fact
that there tends to be many more descriptions than other entity types in a
typical AtoM installation, and information objects are one of the few entity
types in AtoM organized hierarchically.

It is beyond the scope of this documentation to cover all possible forms of
data corruption. Instead, the sections below will provide solutions for the most
common forms of information object data corruption, followed by further
resources should you need to inspect and fix data corruption in other entity
types.

.. _troubleshooting-corruption-ios:

Data corruption in information objects
--------------------------------------

The most common forms of database corruption among information objects (AKA
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`) in AtoM tend to be due to
one of the following:

* Missing :term:`slug`
* Missing :term:`publication status` ID value
* Missing object row values

You can use SQL to check the status of your information objects and see if all
necessary values are present.

.. TIP::

   For basic information on accessing the MySQL database in AtoM from the
   command-line, see:  the following section in the :ref:`common-atom-queries` 
   page: 

   * :ref:`cli-access-mysql`

The following SQL query will output a 4-column table of information objects - the
columns include the information object ID, the object ID, the publication status
ID, and the slug for all descriptions. If any of the resulting rows are missing
values, this will cause the :ref:`search population task <troubleshooting-search-index>`
to throw warnings, and may cause other unexpected errors.

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT io.id as io_id, obj.id as obj_id, st.status_id as pub_status_id, slug.slug
     FROM information_object io
     LEFT JOIN object obj ON io.id=obj.id
     LEFT JOIN status st ON io.id=st.object_id AND st.type_id=158
     LEFT JOIN slug ON slug.object_id=io.id;

The resulting output should look something like this:

.. image:: images/sql-data-corruption.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: An image of the table output by the above SQL command in the console

If you see rows with **missing slugs**, you can use the slug generation task
to resolve this. See above - :ref:`troubleshooting-slugs`.

If you see rows with **missing publication status ID values**, then you can
use SQL to replace these values for each missing instance. You will need to
know the information object ID for the target row (listed in the first column
of the table shown above). In the following example query, ``XXXXX``
represents where the object ID should be added. The third value, represented
by ``YYY`` in the example below, will be the publication status ID value - use
159 to mark the target record as Draft, and 160 to mark the target record as
Published.

.. code-block:: sql

   INSERT INTO status (object_id, type_id, status_id, id, serial_number)
     VALUES ('XXXXX', '158', 'YYY', NULL, '0');

For example, if you found a row with an information object ID value of ``35777``
that was missing a publication status, and you wanted to mark it as Draft:

.. code-block:: sql

   INSERT INTO status (object_id, type_id, status_id, id, serial_number)
     VALUES ('35777', '158', '159', NULL, '0');

If you see rows with a **missing object ID** then congratulations, you have
encountered a rarer form of data corruption! You have two options for addressing
this issue.

The first option is to simply delete the entire row in AtoM - this should cascade
across other related tables. This solution will only work if the target row is
not a :term:`parent record` of other descriptions.

.. WARNING::

   This means you are **completely deleting** this description from AtoM, and
   will need to recreate it manually via import or via the user interface at a
   later date.

To delete the affected row, you will need to know the information object ID
for the target row (listed in the first column of the table shown above). In
the following example query, ``XXXXX`` represents where the object ID should
be added:

.. code-block:: sql

   DELETE FROM information_object WHERE id=XXXXX;

For example, if you wanted to delete an information object with an ``io_id``
value of 39447, enter:

.. code-block:: sql

   DELETE FROM information_object WHERE id=39447;

We recommend that after deleting the affected row via SQL you
:ref:`rebuild the nested set <cli-rebuild-nested-set>` to resolve any corruption
in the hierarchy resulting from your changes.

The second option is to manually insert an object row for the affected record.
To do so, you will need to give it a creation date and time, a last-modified date
and time, and you'll need to know the information object ID of the target record.
The ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` values can be made up or approximated, and
they can also be the same if that's easier. In the following example query,
replace ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`` with your chosen ``created_at`` and ``updated_at``
values, and replace ``XXXXX`` with the information object ID of the target record:

.. code-block:: sql

   INSERT INTO object (class_name, created_at, updated_at, id, serial_number)
     VALUES ('QubitInformationObject', 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss', 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss', 'XXXXX', '0');

For example, if you wanted to say your information object was created on January 1st,
2016 at 1pm, last updated on February 25th, 2018 at 11:45am, and it has an
information object ID of ``63172``, then you could construct the SQL query like so:

.. code-block:: sql

   INSERT INTO object (class_name, created_at, updated_at, id, serial_number)
     VALUES ('QubitInformationObject', '2016-01-01 13:00:00', '2018-02-25 11:45:00', '63172', '0');

Again, we recommend that after making these changes you
:ref:`rebuild the nested set <cli-rebuild-nested-set>` to resolve any corruption
in the hierarchy resulting from your changes.

Finally, there is one other data corruption edge case which can happen in rare
circumstances: when an information object ends up with a duplicated
:term:`publication status`.

You can check for descriptions with a duplicated publication status in your
database with the following query:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT
    st.object_id, st.type_id, st.status_id
    FROM status st
        INNER JOIN (SELECT
                        object_id, type_id, COUNT(*) AS count
                        FROM status
                        WHERE type_id=158
                        GROUP BY object_id, type_id
                        HAVING COUNT(*)>1
                    ) dt ON st.object_id=dt.object_id and st.type_id=dt.type_id;

The following query can then be used to remove one of the duplicated publication
statuses from the affected records. In the following example, we will remove the
:term:`draft <draft record>` status with the publication status ID value of
``159`` in the last part of the query - to remove duplicated
:term:`published <published record>` statuses, change this value to ``160``:

.. code-block:: sql

   DELETE st1
     FROM status as st1, status as st2
       WHERE
            st1.object_id = st2.object_id
         AND st1.type_id = st2.type_id
         AND st1.id > st2.id
         AND st1.type_id = 158
         AND st1.status_id = 159;

As with the other examples above, we recommend that after making these changes
you :ref:`rebuild the nested set <cli-rebuild-nested-set>` to resolve any
corruption in the hierarchy resulting from your changes.

.. _troubleshooting-corruption-other:

Data corruption in other entities
---------------------------------

As noted above, data corruption can potentially occur in any :term:`entity` type
in AtoM, but it is beyond the scope of this documentation to provide a solution to
every possible issue. If you think you are encountering data corruption in
another entity type in AtoM, you'll need to do some research! We have collected
some resources below to assist you.

First, we make copies of the AtoM database's Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
available on the AtoM wiki. An ERD is a data modelling technique that graphically
illustrates an information system's entities and the relationships between those
entities. The AtoM ERDs can help you understand what tables exist in the AtoM
database and how they are related. You can find them on our wiki here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Development/ERDs

We also have some slides that will introduce you to using SQL queries in AtoM,
available here:

* https://www.slideshare.net/accesstomemory/constructing-sql-queries-for-atom

There are also several utilities that can be used to provide a graphical user
interface when exploring AtoM's MySQL database. Two popular utilities that have
been successfully used with AtoM include:

* MySQL Workbench: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
* PHPMyAdmin: https://www.phpmyadmin.net/

Finally, be sure to double-check the MySQL reference documentation for your
version for further tips on constructing SQL queries.

Below are a few extra SQL queries that might be useful when troubleshooting
data corruption in other entity types.

**Repository records**

Finding a :term:`repository` object ID when you know the slug:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT object_id FROM slug WHERE slug='your-institution-slug';

**Terms**

Return the ID of all terms in a particular taxonomy (replace ``Taxonomy name``
in the example below with the name of the target taxonomy):

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT term.id, term_i18n.name
     FROM term
     LEFT JOIN term_i18n ON (term.id = term_i18n.id)
     WHERE term.taxonomy_id = (SELECT id FROM taxonomy_i18n WHERE culture = 'en'
     AND name = 'Taxonomy name') AND term_i18n.culture = 'en';

Return the number of times a term is linked to a description, sorting terms from
most used to least. This will return all terms across taxonomies - if you want
to see only one particular term, uncomment (aka remove the ``#`` at the start of
the line) the ``WHERE`` line and add the target term ID in place of the ``XXX``:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT DISTINCT term_id, term_i18n.name, count(term_id) AS CountOf
     FROM object_term_relation
     JOIN term_i18n ON term_i18n.id = term_id and term_i18n.culture = 'en'
     #WHERE term_id = XXX
     GROUP BY term_id
     ORDER BY CountOf desc;

Troubleshooting FAQ
===================

Below are some initial troubleshooting suggestions for frequently asked questions.

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`faq-white-screen`
* :ref:`faq-500-error`
* :ref:`faq-max-execution`
* :ref:`faq-memory-size`
* :ref:`faq-sql-connections`
* :ref:`faq-mysql-gone-away`
* :ref:`faq-parent-id`
* :ref:`faq-search-pop-warning`

* :ref:`faq-504-error`
* :ref:`faq-treeview`
* :ref:`faq-digital-objects`
* :ref:`faq-login`
* :ref:`faq-not-listed`

.. _faq-white-screen:

Why do I get a blank white screen?
----------------------------------

A blank, white screen in AtoM means that an error has occurred when loading
the page. AtoM usually suppresses error messages in production mode for
security reasons, so the first thing to do is put the application in Debug
mode, then re-try whatever you were doing when you got the white screen. See:

* :ref:`debug-mode`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-logs-debug`


If the page loads with no errors in Debug mode, then you probably just need to
clear the application cache to fix the regular (not in debug mode) webpage. See:

* :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-clear-cache`

If you get an error message, please see if it is addressed below.

If you still get a blank, white screen you will have to check your web server
error log for error messages. See:

* :ref:`maintenance-webserver`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-logs-debug`

.. _faq-500-error:

Why do I get a 500 (Internal Server) error?
-------------------------------------------

.. _AtoM User Forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ica-atom-users

The 500 error is a very general HTTP status code that indicates a problem in the
web server. You will need to check your web server error logs first, to get more
information about the nature of the error. See:

* :ref:`maintenance-webserver`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-logs-debug`

One common cause of 500 errors in AtoM is when AtoM attempts to run an 
asynchronous, but the job scheduler is not running as expected. You will 
know this is the case if you see the following message in the webserver error
log:

.. code-block:: bash

   "No Gearman worker available that can handle the job."

If this is the case, we recommend restarting the ``atom-worker`` and then 
re-trying the task that led to the 500 error. For more information on managing 
the ``atom-worker`` and the job scheduler, see: 

* :ref:`maintenance-asynchronous-jobs`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-job-scheduler`

If you're not sure what to do with the error message you find, and it is not
addressed in the other FAQ sections below, then you can collect as much
information as you can, search the `AtoM User Forum`_, and start a new thread 
if you are unable to find anything relevant that will help you resolve the issue. 
See:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-first-steps`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-support`

.. _faq-max-execution:

Why do I get a "Max execution time" exceeded error?
---------------------------------------------------

If you get an error like the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 60 seconds exceeded in ...

Then you may need to increase your PHP ``max_execution_time`` settings. See
PHP script execution limits for instructions on how to change PHP settings:

* :ref:`installation-execution-limits`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-resources-limits`

.. _faq-memory-size:

Why do I get a "Allowed memory size" exhausted error?
-----------------------------------------------------

If you get an error like the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 67108864 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 233734 bytes) in ...

Then you may need to increase your PHP ``memory_limit`` settings. See
PHP script execution limits for instructions on how to change PHP settings:

* :ref:`installation-execution-limits`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-resources-limits`

.. _faq-sql-connections:

Why do I get a "Too many connections" error?
--------------------------------------------

If you get an error like the following:

.. code-block:: none

   500 | Internal Server Error | PropelException

   Unable to open PDO connection [wrapped: SQLSTATE[08004] [1040] Too many connections]

This is a problem in MySQL, please refer to its documentation - make sure you
are looking at the correct documentation for the version of MySQL have have
installed. Below is a relevant link for MySQL 8.0:

* https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/too-many-connections.html

.. SEEALSO:: 

   * :ref:`common-atom-queries`

.. _faq-mysql-gone-away:

Why do I get a "MySQL has gone away" error?
-------------------------------------------

If you get an error like the following:

.. code-block:: none

   500 | Internal Server Error | PropelException

   [wrapped: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: MySQL server has gone away

This is a problem in MySQL, please refer to its documentation - make sure you
are looking at the correct documentation for the version of MySQL have have
installed. Below is a relevant link for MySQL 8.0:

* https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/gone-away.html

It may be helpful to increase the level of verbosity in the MySQL logs to see if
more details are available. From the MySQL documentation:

  You can get more information about the lost connections by starting MySQL with
  the ``--log-warnings=2`` option. This logs some of the disconnected errors in
  the ``hostname.err`` file. See Section 5.4.2, "The Error Log":

  * https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/error-log.html

.. SEEALSO:: 

   * :ref:`common-atom-queries`

.. _faq-parent-id:

Why do I get a "Parent Resource id: 'XXXXX' does not exist" error?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually this error is due to corruption of the nested set hierarchy of the
resource (e.g. :term:`archival description`, taxonomy :term:`term`). This can
usually be corrected by running the CLI task to rebuild the nested set:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony propel:build-nested-set

For more details on this command, see:

* :ref:`cli-rebuild-nested-set`

You may want to re-populate the search index and clear your application cache
after as well. See:

* :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`
* :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`

If it still doesn't work, then you may want to check for data corruption. See:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-data-corruption`

.. _faq-search-pop-warning:

Why do I get warnings when populating the search index?
-------------------------------------------------------

If you've tried running the ``search:populate`` command (described in detail
:ref:`here<maintenance-populate-search-index>`), and you see the following
warnings at the end of the console output:

.. code-block:: none

   Couldn't find information object (id: XXXXX)

Then Elasticsearch has encountered errors in your data, and was unable to find
the listed :term:`information object` IDs - consequently, these records have not
been added to the search index, and will not be discoverable in the
:term:`user interface` via search and browse.

This warning suggests that there may be some corruption in your data. See the
following section for further suggestions:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-data-corruption`

You can also get basic configuration and status information about your search
index with the following command-line task:

* :ref:`cli-search-status`

.. _faq-search-exception:

Why do I get a SearchPhaseExecutionException when trying to search?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get an error like the following:

.. code-block:: none

   500 | Internal Server Error |  Elastica\Exception\ResponseException

   SearchPhaseExecutionException[Failed to execute phase [query_fetch], all shards failed]

This indicates an issue with Elasticsearch.

First, make sure that you have followed all the installation instructions for
Elasticsearch, as outlined in our recommended installation documentation:

* :ref:`Elasticsearch installation <installation-ubuntu-dependencies-elasticsearch>`

You can get basic configuration and status information about your search index
with the following command-line task: 

* :ref:`cli-search-status`

You can try restarting Elasticsearch with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch

You can then try re-populating the search index and clearing the cache. See:

* :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`
* :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`

If this doesn't resolve the issue and/or you are unable to run the
``search:populate`` task, it may be that Elasticsearch is down. You can check
the status and health of your ES cluster with the following command: :

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health/?level=shards&pretty'

The status of shards must be green or yellow. If the status is any shard is red,
you might want to try to restart Elasticsearch again.

The most common reason for ES failing to start is a lack of available system
resources, such as not enough RAM, CPUs, and/or disk space. Elasticsearch also
has its own configuration file - you might want to review the relevant ES
set-up and configuration documentation:

* ES 1.7: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/setup-configuration.html
* ES 5.x: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.2/settings.html

For more information on troubleshooting Elasticsearch, see: 

* :ref:`maintenance-elasticsearch`

.. _faq-504-error:

Why do I get a 504 Connection timed out error?
----------------------------------------------

A 504 Gateway timeout error usually means that the server acting as a gateway
to handle the HTTP request is either down or too slow to fulfill the request.
This can occur for a number of reasons, and it could be temporary so the first
thing you might want to try is simply repeating the request.

If the 504 timeout reoccurs, we suggest first restarting services, clearing
the application cache, and then monitoring your resources while repeating the
action that lead to the timeout. For information on restarting services and
clearing the application cache, see:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-restart-services`
* :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`

Monitoring your system resources and active processes in real-time while
repeating the action can also provide you with more information about where
the bottleneck is occurring that is leading to the timeout. For information on
monitoring, see above:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-htop`

If you're seeing spikes, then you may need to increase the available system
resources (such memory, CPUs, and/or disk space).

You may also want to analyze your web logs - in many cases where we've seen
significant slowdowns in AtoM it's due to search engine web crawlers making a
lot of requests in a short amount of time - often tens of thousands of
requests a day.  We've had good results with adding a ``robots.txt``
`Crawl-delay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard#Crawl-delay_directive>`__
to slow down requests (30 is a good initial value to try) and blocking
particularly demanding or unwanted web crawlers. For more information, see:

* http://www.robotstxt.org/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard
* https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/robots-testing-tool

You can also look into increasing the execution limits configured for the
site, so that more memory and time is made available before the limits are
reached. More information can be found in the following sections:

* :ref:`installation-execution-limits`

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`faq-digital-objects`

.. _faq-treeview:

Why am I seeing strange behavior in the AtoM treeview?
------------------------------------------------------

If you're using the :ref:`context-menu-treeview-sidebar`, double-check your
Treeview settings (in **Admin > Settings > Treeview**) and ensure the sort is set
to "Manual". There are known issues with the other sort options, particularly if
you have any descriptions missing an identifier or a title. For more context on
this particular issue, see the following issue ticket:

* https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/6574

If you're using the :ref:`context-menu-treeview-full` and you have recently used
the drag-and-drop functionality to reorder sibling records in the treeview
(described in the documentation :ref:`here <change-sort-order>`) and one of the
moved records also has children, it's possible that the background job to update
the :term:`children <child record>` has not yet completed. Wait a moment, and then
refresh your browser. You can also check on the status of the job in the Jobs
page - see:

* :ref:`manage-jobs`

If the job shows errors or refuses to complete, see the section above on
:ref:`troubleshooting-restart-job-scheduler`.

If none of the above is applicable, and/or you are still seeing issues, it
could be that you need to rebuild the nested set. See:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-nested-set`

You might want to clear all application caches after doing so, to ensure you are
seeing the most up-to-date version of the page. See:

* :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache`

Don't forget to clear your web browser's cache as well!

If there are still issues and you've tried all of the above, then it is possible
you are encountering some data corruption. See the following section:

* :ref:`troubleshooting-data-corruption`

.. _faq-digital-objects:

Why can't I upload (large) digital objects?
-------------------------------------------

If you're trying to upload digital objects via the :term:`user interface`
there are a couple things you can start to check. First, AtoM's multi-file
uploader (used to :ref:`upload-multiple-objects` at once) currently requires
Flash to be installed and enabled in your web browser. If you can't see any
upload link, or you are constantly seeing an error in the widget when trying
to upload an image, you may need to enable Flash.

Second, there have been reported issues with some browsers and the multi-uploader.
Try using a different web browser and see if the outcome is different.

If the file is not huge but will not import via the user interface, you should
double-check the various settings available in AtoM that can be used to limit the
size and/or amount of digital objects. There is a global upload limit setting,
and a per-institution upload limit setting. In both cases, set the limit to
``-1`` for no limits on upload size. See:

* :ref:`default-institution-upload`
* :ref:`upload-limit`

There is also a global upload limit maintained in one of AtoM's
:ref:`configuration files <customization-config-files>` - specifically, the
``config/app.yml`` file. You can also set this to ``-1`` to disable upload limits.
See:

* :ref:`config-app-yml`

If the file never uploads, or the process times out while attempting the
upload, then the file itself may be too large to import via the user interface.
One important thing to note is that currently, the digital object
uploads are performed synchronously - that is, on-demand, in real time, via
the web browser. Because most web browsers have a built in timeout limit of
about 1 minute (to prevent long-running requests from consuming all resources
like memory and crashing your browser), your upload may fail if the digital
object is too big.

Note that during installation, there is also a 64MB limit on
``upload_max_filesize``, which is maintained in your ``php.ini`` file. If you
continue to experience timeouts or are running into this size limitation, then
you may need to adjust your PHP execution limits. For more details, see:

* :ref:`installation-execution-limits`

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`faq-504-error`

There are 2 alternative methods of importing digital objects - either with
descriptive data in a CSV import, using the
``digitalObjectPath`` or ``digitalObjectURI`` columns, or using the command-line
``digitalobject:load`` task. These methods either make use of the job scheduler
to perform the import asynchronously in the background, or they are performed via
the terminal, avoiding the web browser and its timeout limits entirely. For more
information, see:

**CSV import documentation**

* :ref:`csv-import` (user interface)
* :ref:`csv-import-cli`
* :ref:`csv-descriptions-digital-objects`

**Digital object load task**

* :ref:`digital-object-load-task`

If you are receiving errors during upload, or the upload is happening but
there are no local copies (like the :term:`thumbnail` in search results)
available, please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* :ref:`other-dependencies`
* :ref:`installation-ubuntu-dependencies-other-packages`

If you have them installed, you can try regenerating your :term:`digital object`
derivatives with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives

For more detailed documentation on this command-line task, see:

* :ref:`cli-regenerate-derivatives`

.. _faq-login:

Why can't I log into AtoM?
--------------------------

It could be that you've forgotten your correct password. If you need to reset
it from the command-line, you can use the following task to change a user
password:

* :ref:`cli-change-password`

Alternatively, you can temporarily create a new :term:`administrator` account
(AKA a "superuser") via the command-line, so you can log in and update your
previous password. You can then delete whichever account you no longer need
from the command-line as well. See:

* :ref:`cli-add-superuser`
* :ref:`cli-delete-user`

If the login button is not showing, it could be that it is simply hidden in
your theme. You can try navigating directly to the login page by adding
``/user/login`` to your base URL. For example, if your AtoM site is normally
available at ``www.my-archives.com``, try navigating to
``www.my-archives.com/user/login``.

If you are simply redirected to the homepage instead of seeing a login screen,
then there are a few possibilities. The first is that you have turned on AtoM's
"Require SSL for all administrator functionality" setting in **Admin > Settings
> Security**, but you do not currently have your SSL certificate properly
configured for your AtoM site, or are trying to login via HTTP instead of HTTPS.
For more on this setting, see: :ref:`security-panel`. Similarly, it could be that
you (or someone else) has configured IP whitelist restrictions via the Security
panel - ensure you are logging in from a white-listed IP.

If you have accidentally turned on the "Require SSL" setting and can't log in,
it's possible to use SQL to disable this setting. For basic information on
accessing MySQL via the command-line, see: :ref:`cli-access-mysql`. You will
need to know the user and password you used for the database when installing AtoM,
as well as the database name.

To use SQL to check and (if necessary) disable the SSL requirement setting, see:

* :ref:`sql-disable-ssl`

The other reason you might be getting booted back to the home page whenever you
try to login is that it's possible login for this installation is disabled via
a setting in one of AtoM's :ref:`configuration files <customization-config-files>`
- specifically, the ``config/app.yml`` file.

Before you update this, double-check: is your installation using a 2-site
deployment model (e.g. one internal read/write site, and a second public facing
read-only catalog)? If yes, are you sure you are trying to log into the internal
site, and not the public read-only site?

If you've checked that you're trying to log into the correct site and you want
to ensure that the ``read_only`` setting is not engaged in your edit site, then
you will want to open the ``config/app.yml`` file via the command-line and
ensure that the ``read_only`` setting is set to ``false``. See:

* :ref:`config-app-yml`

.. IMPORTANT::

   There is also an environment variable maintained in ``/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php-fpm.conf``
   that can override the one in ``config/app.yml``. We recommend checking both
   files. In the ``atom.conf`` file, ensure that ``env[ATOM_READ_ONLY]`` is set
   to "off" to disable this setting and allow users to log in again.
