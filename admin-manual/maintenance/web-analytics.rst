Web analytics
=============

According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics>`__, web
analytics is "*the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of internet
data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage.*"

There are two main technological approaches to collecting the data: logfile
analysis, which reads the logfiles in which the web server records all its
transactions; and page tagging, which uses JavaScript on each page to notify a
third-party server when a page is rendered by a web browser.

.. TIP::

   If your analytics tracker is not working, try turning debugging on and off
   again via ``index.php``. The analytics code should appear in 'View Source'.

   See: :ref:`debug-mode`

Logfile analysis tools
======================

These types of tools require access to the log files generated by the web server.

* AWStats: https://awstats.sourceforge.net/
* Webalizer: https://www.webalizer.net/
* GoAccess: https://goaccess.io/

.. _page-tagging-tools:

Page tagging tools
==================

The tools found under this section require a system administrator or developer
to insert a JavaScript code snippet into the relevant page in AtoM where you'd
like to gather analytic data. The best known open source solutions are probably
`Matomo <https://matomo.org>`_ and `Open Web Analytics <https://openwebanalytics.com/>`_.

You should be able to configure any solution in AtoM by editing the
corresponding
`PHP templates <https://github.com/artefactual/atom/tree/HEAD/apps/qubit/templates>`_.

AtoM also includes built-in integration with `Google Analytics`_, described
further below. By studying the way that the tracking snippets are incorporated
into the PHP templates linked above, you should be able to make modifications
as needed based on your chosen solution to implement something similar.

.. _google-analytics:

Google Analytics
----------------

`Google Analytics`_ is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and
reports website traffic and activity, such as session duration, pages viewed
per session, bounce rates of individuals using the site, and more.

You can configure `Google Analytics`_ in AtoM by adding your tracking
ID to the ``config/app.yml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

     google_analytics_api_key: G-XXXXXXXXXX

Replace ``G-XXXXXXXXXX`` with your tracking ID. Once you are done, remember to
:ref:`clear the cache <maintenance-clear-cache>` and
:ref:`restart PHP-FPM <troubleshooting-restart-php-fpm>`.

.. _google-analytics-repo-pageviews:

Google Analytics for tracking institutional pageviews
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's also possible to track pageviews for individual institutions who are
sharing a multi-repository AtoM instance by adding a custom dimension to the
tracking ID. Adding this dimension will set the authorized form of name from
the source culture of the repository as the dimension value (e.g. for a
repository where the source culture is English but translations into other
languages are present, Analytics will use the English form of the authorized
form of name).

* Description pages (all templates) use the *repository* value (direct or inherited)
* Actor pages use the *maintaining repository* value
* Repository pages use the repository's *authorized form of name* value

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`archival-institutions`
   * :ref:`link-archival-institution`
   * :ref:`link-repo-actor`

Follow the instructions provided in Google's Analytics Help pages to `Create an
event scoped custom dimension`_. When you reach step 5, *Event parameter*, choose
**page_title**. Once you have completed all the steps, the custom dimension will
be displayed in a table. Next, you want to navigate to your AtoM site and access
all of the repositories you would like to track. This step is required so that we
can use the repository's page_title as a variable for filtering for our dimension.
Note that these variables can take up to 24 hours to appear in GA4, and the
following instructions will require access to these variables.

Viewing Google Analytics institutional pageview data
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are several ways to visualize analytics data in the Google Analytics
dashboard. You can view institution names in the page views table:

#. In the Google Analytics dashboard left sidebar, select **Reports**.
#. Under **Life cycle**, select **Engagement** and **Pages and screens**.
#. On the right hand corner, select **Customize report**, then **Dimensions**.
   Add the new dimension to list, and click **Apply**.
#. Next, in the Customize report page, click **Add filter**. Select your custom
   dimension and set the **Match Type** to **exactly matches**, and select all
   repositories you would like to track in the populated list. Note that variables
   are made available on GA4 by accessing them in your AtoM site and can take up
   to 24 hours to populate in GA4.
#. Click **Apply** and **Save** to save your changes. Notice the new filter under
   the *Pages and screens* title and can select your event in the dropdown below
   the table graphs.

      :alt: The Google Analytics page behaviour screen, with the secondary dimension highlighted

#. You can export this data by clicking the **Share this report** button on the
   top right corner. Select **Download File** and select whether you'd prefer a
   **Download PDF** or **Download CSV**.

.. _google-tag-manager:

Google Tag Manager
------------------

Like `Google Analytics`_, `Google Tag Manager`_ is a web based analytics
service offered by Google, with a somewhat different focus. Tag Manager is a
tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily manage
tracking and measurement codes and marketing tags (collectively known as
"tags") on a website or mobile application, without having to modify the code
directly.

These can be used in AtoM to collect end-user analytics in a more granular way
than Google Analytics allows on its own - for example, seeing how often a
:term:`finding aid` is downloaded, or how often a :term:`clipboard` is saved.

The following section will walk you through set-up and configuration of
Tag Manager for use in AtoM, and we'll use tracking finding aid downloads as
an example implementation.

**Requirements**

You'll need to have a `Google Analytics`_ account, and your tracking ID configured
to be able to visualize Tag Manager reports. You'll also need to set up a
`Google Tag Manager account <https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en&ref_topic=3441530>`__, to configure your
containers and tags.

Let's begin!

* :ref:`tag-manager-web-property-config`
* :ref:`tag-manager-container-setup`
* :ref:`tag-manager-variables`
* :ref:`tag-manager-triggers`
* :ref:`tag-manager-findaid-example`
* :ref:`tag-manager-preview`
* :ref:`tag-manager-publish-report`

.. _tag-manager-web-property-config:

Google Analytics tracking ID setup
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. If you haven't already, log in to https://analytics.google.com with a Google
   account and click the "Start collecting data" button.

2. Select **Web** as you platform.

3. Fill out Website URL with your AtoM URL and click **Create**.

4. Accept the service agreement that pops up. You'll be redirected to the
   Tracking Code section of your new web property. Copy down the Tracking ID
   shown on this screen - you'll need this to set up your Google Tag Manager
   variables.

.. image:: images/analytics-property-tracking-code.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: The Tracking ID shown in Analytics after accepting the service agreement

.. _tag-manager-container-setup:

Google Tag Manager container set up
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Log in to https://tagmanager.google.com/ with a Google account and click the
   "Create Account" button.

   .. image:: images/gtm-create-account.*
      :align: center
      :width: 90%
      :alt: Creating an account in Google Tag Manager

   The account will be created with a single Google Tag Manager container and
   you specify its name and type in the Container Setup area. You can specify
   it as a Web container for the AtoM functionality.


2. Click create. You'll be shown a service agreement, and when you click Yes
   to agree to its terms, you'll be redirected to the container dashboard,
   which will show the code snippets for the first time. AtoM will produce
   these automatically from the container ID so you don't need to copy them,
   and can close the dialog.

.. image:: images/gtm-snippets.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager code snippets

3. The ID for your new container will be displayed in the dashboard:

   .. image:: images/gtm-dashboard-container-id.*
      :align: center
      :width: 90%
      :alt: Google Tag Manager dashboard, with the container ID highlighted in
            the top right corner

.. NOTE::
   As of GA4, the GTM ID is no longer required within the AtoM codebase and is
   configured to GA4 within GTM.

   See: `Configure GA4 in GTM`_


4. Once GTM and GA4 are configured, you can start setting up tags to track events
   in your pages and getting reports in Google Analytics.

.. _tag-manager-variables:

Tag Manager Variables
+++++++++++++++++++++

In the following example we're going to track Click events (buttons, links,
etc). First we need to enable the built-in "Clicks" variables, and make a few
other configuration changes.

1. Click "Variables" in the left sidebar and then the "Configure" button in the
   Built-in Variables section.

.. image:: images/gtm-variables.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Variables configuration page

2. Enable all the Clicks variables:

.. image:: images/gtm-variables-enable.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Variables configuration page

3. We can also create a variable to store the Tracking ID of the
   `Google Analytics`_ web property we set up in the section
   :ref:`above <tag-manager-web-property-config>`, so we can reuse it in
   multiple tags.

   To do so, click "Variables" in the left sidebar and then the "New" button in
   the *User-Defined Variables* section.

.. image:: images/gtm-variables.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Variables configuration page

4. In the **Variable Configuration** section, click the Lego block icon or the
   pencil icon to get started. In the resulting configuration page, select the
   Google Analytics Settings type, and set the Tracking ID of your Google
   Analytics web property. At the top of the page, we'll also name the new
   variable "Tracking ID" so we can identify it when setting tags. When this
   is complete, click the "Save" button.

.. image:: images/gtm-variables-tracking-id.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Variables configuration page

.. _tag-manager-triggers:

Tag Manager Triggers
++++++++++++++++++++

Triggers listen to events on specific page elements and make tags react when
the event is detected. We're going to create a trigger to listen to click
events on the Download button of the :term:`Finding aids <finding aid>` section
of the right-hand :term:`context menu` of an :term:`archival description`. Note
that this button is just an HTML link element styled to look like a button.
Let's set up a trigger for this event.

.. SEEALSO::

   :ref:`print-finding-aids`

1. Click "Triggers" in the left sidebar, and the "New" button in the Triggers
   section.

.. image:: images/gtm-triggers.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Triggers page

2. In the Trigger Configuration section click the circled button or the pencil
   icon and choose the "Just Links" trigger type under the Click category.

.. image:: images/gtm-triggers-just-links.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Triggers page - choosing the trigger type

3. Under "This trigger fires on," select "Some Link Clicks," which allows you
   to define selectors to identify the specific HTML elements you want to
   track. This will depend on the markup of the page and how specific you want
   to be. A selector like ``#action-items a.btn`` (all links that look like a
   button on the right sidebar) might be good enough or ``#action-items
   a.btn[href$=".pdf"]`` (all links that look like a button on the right
   sidebar and where the ``href`` URI ends in ``.pdf``) might be way more
   specific. Name the trigger "Download button" and then click the Save button
   at the top of the screen.

.. image:: images/gtm-triggers-download-button.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Triggers configuration panel

.. _tag-manager-findaid-example:

Tag example: tracking finding aid downloads
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that we've configured our Variables and Triggers, in the following example
we're going to track how many times users click the :term:`finding aid` Download
button in the right :term:`context menu` of an :term:`archival description`.
We are going to generate a report that groups all these events in the single
category of "Finding Aids," and which shows the URL of their related archival
description.

1. Click "Tags" on the left sidebar and the New button in the Tags section.

.. image:: images/gtm-tags.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Tags landing page

2. In the Tag Configuration section, click the tag button or the pencil icon
   and choose the "Google Analytics: Universal Analytics" type. For Track Type
   select "Event" and for the Google Analytics Setting, select your Tracking
   ID variable.

.. image:: images/gtm-tags-config.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Tags configuration panel

3. The Category, Action and Label tracking parameters are arbitrary values
   that become dimensions in the `Google Analytics`_ event reports so you can
   adjust them conveniently. For example, we're going to use the URL of the
   archival description as the Event label, so click the lego block button
   next to the field and select the "Click URL" variable.

.. image:: images/gtm-tags-event.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Tags configuration panel - setting the Event label

4. In the Triggering section click the circled button or the pencil and choose
   the Download button we configured in the
   :ref:`previous section <tag-manager-triggers>`.

.. image:: images/gtm-tags-choose-trigger.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Tags configuration panel - choosing the trigger

5. Finally, name your tag "Finding Aids Download" and click the Save button at
   the top of the screen.

.. image:: images/gtm-tags-finding-aids-download.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Google Tag Manager Tags configuration panel - choosing the trigger

We're almost set! Let's preview our work and make sure everything is working
as expected.

.. _tag-manager-preview:

Previewing your Google Tag functionality
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before publishing your new tag you can preview its functionality by clicking
the Preview button in the container dashboard. Once you're in preview mode you
can open a new tab in the same browser and visit your site.

You'll see a Tag Manager pane at the bottom of your page.

.. image:: images/gtm-preview.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: Previewing your AtoM site via Google Tag Manager

If you click the :term:`finding aid` download button of an
:term:`archival description`, the PDF will be open in a new tab and you'll see a
new Click event in the Summary sidebar showing that the tag was successfully
fired.

.. _tag-manager-publish-report:

Publishing your tag and getting an Analytics event report
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After you check that the tag works you can publish your workspace by clicking
the "Submit" button in the `Google Tag Manager`_ Container dashboard. Set a name
and description for the version changes and click the "Publish" button.
