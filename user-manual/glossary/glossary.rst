  About page
    The about page provides general information on AtoM. It can be reached
    via the :term:`header bar` at the top of all pages. The content of the
    about page can be edited by  :term:`administrators <administrator>`
    (see :ref:`Manage static pages <manage-static-pages>`).

  Accession record
    The accession record is an administrative and descriptive document that
    summarizes standard information about the process of transferring materials
    to a :term:`repository`, including information about the provenance,
    contents and legal and physical transfer of the records such as, rights and
    restrictions. See :ref:`entity-types` and :ref:`accession-records`.

  Access point
    An access point is "A name, term, keyword, phrase or code that may be
    used to search, identify and locate an archival description." (ISAD
    glossary). In AtoM, access points are derived from :term:`authority
    records <authority record>` and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` created
    and customized by users. See :ref:`terms`.

  Access privilege
    Access privileges control the ways a user is able to interact with
    AtoM. For example, some users are able to add and edit content while
    others may only be able to search and browse content. Access
    privileges are based on defined :term:`user roles <user role>` (see
    :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`). See : :ref:`edit-user-permissions`.

  Accrual
    An accrual is "an acquisition additional to a unit of description
    already held by a :term:`repository`." (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, an
    accrual can be added to an existing :term:`accession record`. See:
    :ref:`Accessions <accession-records>`.

  Act
    According to PREMIS, an act is "The action the preservation repository is
    allowed to take." In AtoM, a set vocabulary of acts are used in PREMIS rights
    records, which are then actionable upon digital objects. See:
    :ref:`Rights <rights>`.

  Add menu
    The "Add" menu allows authorized users to add new :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records
    <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and :term:`functions <function>`.
    Only logged-in users can see the "Add" menu, which appears in the
    :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`. See: :ref:`main-menu`.

  Add new button
    The add new button is located in the :term:`button block <button
    block>` of the :term:`view page <view page>` and allows users to add
    new records (:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, and :term:`terms <term>`) to
    AtoM.

  Admin menu
    The admin menu allows users with :term:`administrator <administrator>`
    access to customize AtoM to meet institution-specific requirements and
    to manage :term:`user accounts <user account>` and :term:`user
    profiles <user profile>`. The admin menu is only visible to users with
    administrator privileges. See :ref:`Administer <administer>` and
    :ref:`main-menu-admin`.

  Administration area
    The Administration area is part of the resource description edit
    template. It allows the User to change the publication status of the
    resource - Draft (this resource description is not available for
    public viewing) and Published (this resource description is available
    for public viewing). It also allows the user to set a default
    :term:`display standard` for an :term:`archival description`.

  Administrator
    The administrator is a type of user who has :term:`access privileges
    <access privilege>` to do the following: install or uninstall AtoM;
    create, read, update, or delete any record; customize AtoM to
    institution-specific requirements or themes; and manage :term:`user
    accounts <user account>` and :term:`user profiles <user profile>` (see
    :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` and :ref:`Administer <administer>`).

  Advanced search
    The advanced search is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain
    text matching a search query. The advanced search hyperlink can be
    accessed in the drop-down that appears when a user places the cursor
    in the :term:`search box`. It is also available on all
    :term:`archival description` search and browse pages, in the
    :term:`Advanced search panel`. In the advanced search panel, the user can
    select "and, or, not" operators, and search specific fields, to create
    a powerful search query. The option to apply filters to limit or
    narrow the search are also provided. See: :ref:`advanced-search`.

  Advanced search panel
    The advanced search panel appears on :term:`archival description` search
    and browse pages, contained in a collapsible section at the top of the
    results page. Click on the panel to expand or collapse it. The options in
    the panel can be used to perform advanced search queries, and/or to
    further refine initial search or browse results. For more information,
    see: :ref:`advanced-search`.

  Archival description
    An archival description is a body of information about an archival
    record or records. The descriptions provide contextual information
    about the archival materials and are arranged into hierarchical levels
    (:term:`fonds`, series, files, items, and variations of these in
    accordance with institutional standards).

    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines an archival description as "The creation of an accurate
    representation of a unit of description and its component parts, if
    any, by capturing, analyzing, organizing and recording information
    that serves to identify, manage, locate and explain archival materials
    and the context and records systems which produced it. This term also
    describes the products of the process" (ISAD glossary).

    In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used for describing
    archival records are derived from the ICA's *General International
    Standard Archival Description* (ISAD). See :ref:`entity-types` and
    :ref:`archival-descriptions`.

  Archival institution
    An archival institution is "An organization which keeps and preserves
    archival material and makes it accessible to the public" (ISDIAH
    glossary). In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to
    describe such institutions are based on the ICA's *International Standard
    for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings* (ISDIAH). See
    :ref:`entity-types` and :ref:`Archival institutions <archival-institutions>`.

  Archival unit
    Archival unit is a generic term for an aggregation of archival
    materials. A unit can be a :term:`fonds`, series, file, item, or
    variation thereof, depending on institutional standards. A unit may be
    divided into sub-units for the purposes of description: e.g. a
    :term:`fonds` may contain several series, each of which may contain
    several files, and so forth. The smallest (and therefore indivisible)
    unit is the item. See also :term:`level of description`.

  Area header
    The title/heading that appears at the top of :term:`information areas
    <information area>` in :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`,
    :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions
    <function>`, and other records. When an authenticated (i.e., logged in)
    user with edit privileges clicks on the heading of an :term:`information
    area` when in :term:`view mode`, the page reloads in :term:`edit mode` so
    the user can edit content. See: :ref:`recurring-information-areas`.

  Arrangement
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines arrangement as "the intellectual and physical processes and
    results of analyzing and organizing documents in accordance with
    archival principles" (ISAD glossary).

  Authority record
    In AtoM, authority records are collections of information about actors
    - corporate bodies, persons, or families - who interact with archival
    materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. The :term:`data
    elements <data element>` used to describe authority records are based
    on the ICA's *International Standard Archival Authority Record for
    Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (ISAAR). ISAAR defines
    authority record as "The authorized form of name combined with other
    information elements that identify and describe the named entity and
    may also point to other related authority records." See :ref:`entity-types`
    and :ref:`authority-records`.

  Base URL
    The base URL is used to create absolute URLs included in XML exports (e.g.
    MODS and EAD exports). For example, your AtoM site is made up a series of
    web pages. Each page has a full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) something
    like ``http://www.your-atom-site.com/your-description``. The Base URL is the
    part of this URL that does not change - in this example,
    ``http://www.your-atom-site.com``.

    Setting this value will ensure that links included in your XML exports will
    be properly formed. The Base URL value can be set in AtoM via **Admin >
    Settings > Site information**. See: :ref:`site-information`.

  Boolean search
    Boolean searching is a particular application of what is known as Boolean
    logic, a subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements
    originally developed by George Boole, a 19th century English
    mathematician. Since computers operate in binary (using ones and zeroes),
    computer logic can often be expressed in Boolean terms (true/false).
    Boolean expressions use a number of operators, the most common of which
    are AND, OR, and NOT - using Boolean operators in terms of search queries
    (Boolean search) allows a user to limit, widen, or otherwise define a
    search in granular terms. Most modern web search engines support Boolean
    search statements,allowing complex queries to be expressed in human-
    readable form - for example, searching "fonds OR collection" would widen a
    search to include results that have either term in their title. In AtoM,
    Boolean search operators are supported in the :term:`search box` and in
    the Advanced search menu - see: :ref:`Search <search-atom>` and
    :ref:`Advanced search <advanced-search>`.

  Breadcrumb trail
    A breadcrumb trail is a navigational element in a :term:`user interface`
    that provides contextual information about the current location of a user
    in an application or document. Breadcrumb trails provide links back to
    each previous page the user navigated through to get to the current page
    or — in hierarchical site structures — the parent pages of the current
    one.

    In AtoM a breadcrumb trail is displayed to add contextual information and
    to facilitate navigation in several places. On :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, the breadcrumb trail is located at
    the top of record's :term:`view page` when viewing a :term:`child
    description <child record>` to provide information about where in the
    hierarchy the current description appears. When moving archival
    descriptions (see: :ref:`move-archival-description`), A breadcrumb trail
    is used to indicate where in a hierarchy the Move browse results are
    currently showing. At the top of:term:`archival institution` and
    :term:`authority record` view pages, the breadcrumb trail is used
    to provide a link back to the Browse page for each kind of record.
    Additionally, :term:`taxonomy` :term:`terms <term>` (such as
    :term:`places <place>` and :term:`subjects <subject>`) that are
    organized hierarchically will also display parent terms as a breadcrumb
    trail when added to an :term:`archival description` - for example, if the
    subject term 'Apple' is a child of the term 'Fruit', then when 'Apple' is
    added as a subject :term:`access point` to an
    :term:`archival description`, it will be expressed as: **Fruit >> Apple**

    In AtoM, breadcrumbs (i.e. individual components of a breadcrumb trail)
    are expressed as hyperlinks, and can be clicked to navigate to the related
    source or parent record.

  Browse menu
    Browsing allows a user to see all records that have a certain type of
    :term:`access point` (such as :term:`subject`, :term:`name`, or
    :term:`place`) or other type of filter, such as :term:`media type` or
    type of :term:`entity`. In AtoM's default theme (the Dominion theme)
    the browse menu appears in a drop-down next to the :term:`search box`
    in the :term:`header bar` on all pages, as well as on the :term:`home
    page`. See: :ref:`navigate` and :ref:`Browse <browse>`; see also:
    :ref:`browse-menu`.

  Button block
    The button block allows authorized users to add, edit, delete, move,
    and duplicate content and to save or cancel changes made in the
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. See: :ref:`recurring-button-block`.

  Carousel
    The carousel shows sets of :term:`thumbnails <thumbnail>` of
    :term:`digital objects <digital object>` and allows the user to scroll
    through the thumbnails using a mouse or keyboard scroll arrows. It is
    similar to the `cover flow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_flow>`_
    used in "the Macintosh Finder" and other Apple Inc. products for
    visually flipping through snapshots of documents, website bookmarks,
    album artwork, or photographs. In AtoM, a carousel viewer appears at
    the top of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`
    whenever there are associated lower-level descriptions that have
    digital objects attached. See: :ref:`recurring-carousel`; see also:
    :ref:`upload-digital-object`.

  Child record
    Child record refers to a description of the :term:`archival unit` that
    is one :term:`level of description` lower than the current unit, e.g.
    if a series belongs to a :term:`fonds`, the series is the child record
    of the fonds. :term:`Terms <term>` can also be organized hierarchically
    (with parent-child relationships) in a :term:`taxonomy`, and expressed as
    broader or narrower terms. A narrower term would be a child of the parent
    broader term. See also: :term:`Parent record`.

  Clipboard
    The Clipboard is a :term:`user interface` element that allows users to
    select records while searching and browsing, and add them to a list (the
    "clipboard"), for later review or further action. Authenticated users (i.e.
    those logged in) can also perform CSV exports of Clipboard results via the
    user interface. The clipboard is **session-based** - meaning that it does
    not persist between user sessions. When you close your browser, any
    results on the clipboard will be lost. However, users have the option of
    saving clipboard results, which can then be loaded in a future session.
    See: :ref:`clipboard`

  Clipboard menu
    The Clipboard menu appears in the AtoM :term:`header bar` for all users.
    It is represented by a paperclip icon, and allows users to manage
    :term:`Clipboard` selections as the navigate around the application. See:
    :ref:`clipboard`, especially :ref:`clipboard-menu`.

  Collection
    In ISAD, a collection is "[a]n artificial assemblage of documents
    accumulated on the basis of some common characteristic without regard
    to the provenance of those documents. Not to be confused with an
    archival fonds." In the Canadian Rules for Archival Description, it is
    "[a] grouping of documents of any provenance intentionally assembled
    on the basis of some common characteristic." In Dublin Core, a
    collection is "[a]n aggregation of resources. A collection is
    described as a group; its parts may also be separately described."

  Color picker
    A color picker is a graphical :term:`user interface` element that allows
    users to set a :term:`hex color code` when theming an element of the
    application by selecting from a visual representation of a color palette,
    instead of keying in alphanumeric values such as a :term:`hex color code`.
    In AtoM, the color picker is made up of a text-box where users can enter a
    :term:`hex color code`, a preview box where the color selected is
    displayed, a slider (on the right-hand side of the drop-down) where a user
    can select a hue, and a palette (main part of drop-down) where a user can
    select a tint. In AtoM a color picker is used when choosing the background
    color of an :term:`archival institution` - see:
    :ref:`change-institution-background`.

  Column header
    :term:`Column headers <column header>` appear at the top of the lists on
    list pages and some browse results (e.g., :term:`subject` and :term:`place`
    browse pages), and give the name of the :term:`field` for whatever is
    being listed below. On some pages, the column headers include a
    |caret-down-grey| caret icon next to the column header :term:`field` name
    - when clicked, these icons will reverse the sort order of the data in the
    list based on that column (i.e., changing from A-Z to Z-A, or from most
    recently updated first to oldest update first).

    Column headers appear wherever display data on a page has been organized
    into a table, and are used extensively throughout the pages available in
    the :ref:`Admin menu <main-menu-admin>`. See: :ref:`Column headers
    <recurring-column-headers>` for screenshots.

  Context menu
    The context menu appears on all :term:`view pages <view page>` and some
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>` to provide greater contextual information
    about the record currently being viewed.

    AtoM's :term:`view pages <view page>` and :term:`edit pages <edit page>`
    are generally displayed in the :term:`user interface` in either a 2 or 3
    column  layout - the current record’s display data is presented in the
    central part of  the page, while the side column(s) are generally used to
    provide additional options and further contextual information to enhance
    user orientation and navigation. These side columns make up the context
    menu.

    The information provided in the context menu varies by the
    :term:`entity` type (i.e. :term:`archival description`
    :term:`view pages <view page>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>` or
    :term:`archival institution`) or display. For more information and
    screenshots, see: :ref:`context-menu` and :ref:`recurring-page-elements`.

  Contributor
    A contributor is a type of user who can search, browse, create, and
    edit descriptions. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`; see also
    :ref:`contributor-default`.

  Controlled vocabulary
    A controlled vocabulary is a set of pre-defined, authorized
    :term:`terms <term>` grouped into :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` or
    entered into :term:`authority records <authority record>` and used for
    generating :term:`value lists <value list>` and :term:`access points
    <access point>`. See :ref:`terms`.

  Converse term
    A :term:`term` that has an inverse reciprocal relationship to another
    term in the same :term:`taxonomy`. Converse term relationships can be
    managed via a term's :term:`edit page`; currently converse relationships
    are only used in the Actor relations taxonomy, though the field is available
    in all term edit pages. Examples of default converse terms include: *is the
    parent of* and *is the child of*, or *is the employer of* and *is the
    employee of*. Actor relation terms are used in the ISAAR Relationships
    dialogue to establish relationships between
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`. When one term is added as a
    relationship qualifier to an authority record, its converse term will
    automatically appear on the related authority record. A term whose converse
    is itself (e.g. *is the sibling of*) is known as a
    :term:`self-reciprocal term`. For more information, see:
    :ref:`add-converse-term` and :ref:`link-two-authority-records`.

  Corporate body
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines a corporate body as "An organization or group of persons that
    is identified by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an
    entity" (ISAD glossary).

    Similarly, in the Canadian Rules for Archival Description (RAD), a
    corporate body is defined as "an organization or association of
    persons that is identified by a particular name and that acts, or may
    act, as an entity. Typical examples of corporate bodies are societies,
    institutions, business firms, nonprofit enterprises, governments,
    government agencies, religious bodies, places of worship, and
    conferences."

  Create button
    The create button, located on the :term:`button block`, is used to
    save new :term:`entities <entity>`. Once an entity has been saved for
    the first time, the create button disappears and is replaced by the
    "Save" button, which is used to save all subsequent changes. See:
    :ref:`recurring-button-block`.

  Creator
    A creator is "any entity (:term:`corporate body`, family or person)
    that created, accumulated and/or maintained records in the conduct of
    personal or corporate activity" (ISAAR glossary). In AtoM, the creator
    is described in an :term:`authority record` linked to an
    :term:`archival description`, usually at the highest :term:`level of
    description` only. Lower levels inherit the creator from the
    :term:`parent record`, unless a different creator is specified. AtoM
    can accommodate multiple creators at all levels of description.
    Information about the creator is entered into the context area in the
    archival description :term:`edit page` (ISAD-G template).

  CSV
    Most often understood as an acronym for "comma-separated values" (though
    sometimes called "character-separated values" because the separator
    character does not have to be a comma), CSV is a file format that stores
    tabular data in plain-text form. Information with common properties that
    can be expressed as a sequence of fields sharing a common header can be
    stored in plain-text using the CSV format, making it application agnostic
    and highly transportable.

    A CSV file consists of a number of records (rows), that have identical
    fields, separated by commas (or in some cases, another separator). Often a
    header column (i.e. the cell values in first or top row of a CSV file) is
    included, naming each column and indicating what kind of data the column
    contains. Data is then entered using a separator or delimiter (such as a
    comma) to indicate a separation of fields (or cells), and a line break or
    carriage return to indicate rows (i.e. different records). Most
    spreadsheet applications (such as OpenOffice Calc or MS Excel) can open
    CSV files and express them as a spreadsheet. See
    `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`__ for more
    information on CSV. In AtoM, CSV templates conforming to content standards
    templates such as :ref:`ISAD(G) <isad-template>` and
    :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` can be used to migrate large datasets into the
    application. For more information, see: :ref:`csv-import`.

  Current language
    Refers to the language in which the :term:`user interface` elements
    and :term:`database content` are displayed. Users can switch between
    languages by using the :term:`language menu`. See: :ref:`language-menu`.

  Data element
    Data elements, or elements of description, are `ICA
    <http://www.ica.org>`__ standards-based units of information applied
    to :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, and :term:`terms <term>`. The
    elements are entered into fields in AtoM's
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

  Database content
    Database content refers to information stored in Atom's database
    tables, including :term:`data elements <data element>`, :term:`static
    page` content, and :term:`user profile` information.

  Deaccession record
    The deaccession record is used to indicate that a :term:`repository` has
    removed an accession, in part or whole, from the collection. Instead
    of deleting an :term:`accession record`, the repository will create a
    deaccession record that is kept. See: :ref:`deaccessions`.

  Dedicated search box
    A search box, generally provided on a :ref:`Browse page
    <page-type-browse>`, that will search only one :term:`entity` or record
    type, giving users a means to search for particular content within that
    type. In AtoM, dedicated search bars are provided for: Accessions, Archival
    institutions, authority records, Place terms, Subject terms, Donors,
    Rights holders, Functions, and Users. For more information, see:
    :ref:`dedicated-search`.

  Default content
    Default content is any :term:`database content` that is included by
    default when AtoM is installed. This includes things like the default
    :term:`home page` and :term:`drop-down menu` values that are stored in
    :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>`.

  Default language
    The default language is the language in which all :term:`user
    interface` elements are displayed when AtoM is opened. The language is
    specified when the application is installed. Users can switch to other
    :term:`supported languages <supported language>` (see: :ref:`language-menu`)
    and :term:`translators <translator>` can translate :term:`database content`
    and :term:`user interface` elements. See :ref:`choose-language` and
    :ref:`Translate <translate>`.

  Delete button
    The delete button appears in the :term:`button block`. Clicking on the
    delete button will prompt a warning to appear asking whether the user
    really intends to delete the :term:`entity`. See:
    :ref:`recurring-button-block`.

  Delete icon
    Delete icons are small buttons in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` used
    to delete values from :term:`multi-value fields <multi-value field>`,
    such as those containing :term:`event` dates or :term:`access points
    <access point>`. They are generally portrayed as an "**X**".

  Developer
    A developer is a `programmer
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer>`_ who is able to modify the
    underlying software code of an AtoM application.

  Digital object
    Digital objects are computer files that can be uploaded into and
    displayed by AtoM. They include scanned images, digital photographs,
    sound and moving image files, and other scanned or born-digital items.
    See :ref:`upload-digital-object` and :ref:`File formats <file-formats>`.

  Display standard
    The display standard indicates which archival description standard is
    used to display and edit the :term:`archival unit`. The default
    display standard for the application can be set by an
    :term:`Administrator <administrator>` in the Default template area of
    the Settings menu. See :ref:`settings`.

    AtoM also allows an authenticated user with the appropriate
    permissions to set which :term:`archival description` standards
    template is used to display the current description, and if desired,
    all of its related :term:`child records <child record>`. Users can
    select from multiple standards-based templates supported in AtoM.
    Using this feature, located in the :term:`Administration area
    <administration area>` of an :term:`archival description`'s
    :term:`edit page`, users can choose if archival descriptions held by
    the same :term:`archival institution` are displayed to end-users with
    different archival standards templates, or even if different
    :term:`levels of description <level of description>` in the same
    :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection` are displayed with different
    standards templates. See :ref:`entity-types`, :ref:`descriptive-standards`,
    and :ref:`archival-descriptions`.

  Document
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org>`__),
    in the ISAD glossary, defines a document as "recorded information
    regardless of medium or characteristics. (See also
    :term:`Record <record>`)".

  Dominion theme
     The Dominion theme is the default theme that ships with AtoM 2.0. It has
     been built using `Twitter Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__,
     with some added `JavaScript <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript>`__
     elements, and features a black :term:`header bar` and a light grey
     application background color. AtoM 2.7 ships with a newer version of the
     Dominion theme based on Bootsrap version 5 that provides accessibility and
     other user interface improvements. AtoM has been designed so that other
     themes can be added to the application as plugins, after which an
     :term:`administrator` can change the application theme via the
     :term:`user interface` by navigating to **Admin > Themes**. See
     :ref:`Themes and theming <themes>`.

  Donor dialog
    The dialog that opens when adding donor contact information to the
    :term:`accession record` or when selecting to edit an existing donor
    record. Donor records are located under the "Manage" tab in the menu.
    Donor records are only available to logged-in users with permissions.
    See: :ref:`donors`.

  Draft record
    A draft record is an :term:`archival description` that has not been
    published. All new and imported :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>` have draft status until the user changes that status to
    published in the :term:`Administration area <administration area>` the
    bottom of the archival description :term:`edit page`. The
    :term:`Administrator <administrator>` can change the default
    publication status from draft to published in the **Admin > Settings >
    Global > Default publication status**.

    The publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level of
    description`. Users who are not authenticated cannot view draft
    records. See also :term:`Published record <published record>`. See:
    :ref:`Publish an archival description <publish-archival-description>`.

  Drop-down menu
    A drop-down list menu is a list of data-entry options that appears
    below certain :term:`fields <field>` in :term:`edit pages <edit
    page>`. Values are drawn from :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled
    vocabulary>` :term:`terms <term>`, :term:`authority records <authority
    record>`, and default data contained in AtoM's database tables.

  Duplicate button
    The duplicate button appears at the bottom of the :term:`view page`;
    clicking the button takes the user to the :term:`edit duplicate`; this
    page is an :term:`edit page` that is pre-populated with the existing
    data from the original record. The user can edit the duplicate record
    page and then save it as a new record. Some users use the duplicate
    function in AtoM like a record skeleton when doing large amounts of
    data-entry on similar records. See:
    :ref:`duplicate-archival-description`; see also:
    :ref:`recurring-button-block`.

  Edit button
    The edit button appears at the bottom of :term:`view pages <view
    page>`; clicking the button takes the user to the :term:`edit page`
    for that :term:`record`.

    The user can also switch between view and edit pages by clicking the
    :term:`title bar` of an :term:`information area`. See:
    :ref:`recurring-button-block`.

  Edit duplicate
    After the user clicks the :term:`duplicate button` the :term:`edit
    page` provides a warning. The user is now editing a duplicate record
    (automatically draft status). After editing the duplicate record the
    user can click the cancel or save button at the bottom of the screen.

  Edit icon
    The edit icon appears in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` next to
    :term:`fields <field>` that derive data from a related record. The
    user clicks the icon to edit the text in the related record, e.g. to
    edit the "Administrative/biographical history" in an :term:`archival
    description`, the user must click the edit icon because the data
    resides in the :term:`creator's <creator>` :term:`authority record`.

  Edit mode
    Edit mode allows the user to add, modify, or delete the contents of
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and other database content using
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In edit mode, AtoM displays all
    :term:`fields <field>` in a :term:`record` for data entry.

  Editor
    An editor is a type of user who can search, browse, add, edit and
    delete :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`,
    and :term:`terms <term>`. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

  Edit page
    Edit pages allow users to add, edit and delete the contents of
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and
    :term:`accession records <accession record>`. They are also used to carry
    out administrative functions such as changing :term:`user profiles <user
    profile>` and editing :term:`static pages <static page>`.

  Entity
    An entity is an object about which an information system collects
    data. From the user's perspective, in AtoM there are six main
    entities: :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`,
    :term:`rights records <rights record>`, and :term:`terms <term>`. See
    :ref:`entity-types`.

  Error message
    An error message will display when AtoM is unable to execute an
    action. See :ref:`Error <page-type-error>` for examples of types of error
    messages.

  Event
    In AtoM, an event registers an action by an actor (:term:`corporate
    body`, person, or family) at a particular time or over a span of time
    and may establish a relationship between the actor and other actors or
    :term:`entities <entity>`. This is accomplished through the use of
    start and end dates in the context area of the :term:`archival
    description` (ISAD-G template), which links the :term:`creator` or other actor to the records for the period of time delimited by the dates. See
    :ref:`entity-types` and :ref:`context-menu`.

  Facet filter
    In information science, a facet is a clearly defined component (based on a
    particular concept group, characteristic or aspect) of a class or subject.
    Facets are used in a system of faceted classification, which "*allows the
    assignment of an object to multiple characteristics (attributes), enabling
    the classification to be ordered in multiple ways, rather than in a
    single, predetermined, taxonomic order.*" (`Wikipedia
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification>`__).

    Facets are made up of clearly defined, often mutually exclusive categories
    drawn from the properties of a group of information elements. When applied
    as filters, facets allow a user to access and order query (search or
    browse) results in multiple ways dynamically.

    In AtoM, facet filters are available to users on search and browse pages as
    a means of grouping and narrowing results. They are drawn from available
    :term:`fields <field>` within the :ref:`entity type <entity-types>` being
    browsed or searched. For further information and usage, see:
    :ref:`recurring-facet-filters` and :ref:`settings`. See also:
    :ref:`Browse <browse>`, :ref:`search-atom`, and :ref:`Navigate <navigate>`.

  Facets title

    The facets title is the text that appear above the list of
    :term:`facet filter` headings and results. By default, the text appears as
    "Narrow your results by:". For further information and usage, see:
    :ref:`recurring-facet-filters` and :ref:`settings`. See also:
    :ref:`Browse <browse>`, :ref:`search-atom`, and :ref:`Navigate <navigate>`.

  Field
    A field is a container for a :term:`data element`. Content is added to
    or modified in fields in :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. For further
    information, see the Wikipedia entry for `Field
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28computer_science%29>`_.

  Field label
    Field labels identify :term:`fields <field>` in :term:`view pages
    <view page>` and :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In AtoM, the
    :term:`Administrator <administrator>` can select certain field labels
    and hide them from public (unauthorized Users) views. See
    :ref:`visible-elements`.

  Filter tag
    A filter tag appears at the top of a search or browse results page when a
    user arrives there with a search already delimited to a particular
    :term:`collection`, :term:`archival institution`, or other aspect of the
    results (for example, showing only :term:`digital objects <digital
    object>`). Displayed as a white tag with orange text indicating the
    filter being applied (for example, the name of a :term:`repository` to
    which search or browse results have been limited), the filter tag also
    includes a grey "**X**" that, when clicked by a user, will remove the
    filter and reload the page to display global search results (i.e. results
    from throughout all :term:`holdings` in the application).

    The most common uses of filter tags in AtoM are: **1)** When a user clicks
    the "Show results with digital objects" option provided at the top of
    :term:`archival description` search/browse pages, the page will reload
    with a filter tag in place reading, "Only digital objects." **2)** When a
    user performs a search in the :term:`search box` using the
    :ref:`search-box-delimiters`, a search results page with a filter tag for
    that institution will appear (limiting results to the :term:`holdings` of
    the related :term:`repository`). **3)** When a user visits an
    :term:`archival institution` page, and clicks the "Browse # holdings"
    option below the list of the institution's :term:`holdings` in the left-hand
    :term:`context menu`, a browse results page with a filter tag for that
    institution will appear. **4)** When a user performs a :ref:`quick search
    <treeview-search>` on an :term:`archival description` using the
    :term:`treeview` search tab, an option to "Browse all descriptions" is
    presented. If the user clicks the option, AtoM will redirect the user to a
    browse page with a filter tag in place limiting the results to the current
    :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection`. In all cases, clicking the "**X**"
    will remove the filter tag and reload the search results correspondingly.

    See: :ref:`search-atom`; see particularly :ref:`search-box-delimiters`
    for a screenshot and example application of the filter tags.

  Finding aid
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines a finding aid as "The broadest term to cover any description
    or means of reference made or received by an archives service in the
    course of establishing administrative or intellectual control over
    archival material" (ISAD Glossary)

    The finding aid is a tool for discovering information about the
    :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection`. In AtoM, the entirety of an
    archival description (including all :term:`child records <child
    record>` and the :term:`parent record` can be understood as an online
    finding aid, used for discovery and access. The View archival
    description screen can also be printed and saved as a Finding Aid in
    `pdf <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format>`_.

  Fonds
    Fonds is an :term:`archival unit` defined as "The whole of the
    records, regardless of form or medium, organically created and/or
    accumulated and used by a particular person, family, or
    :term:`corporate body` in the course of that :term:`creator's
    <creator>` activities and :term:`functions <function>`." (ISAD
    glossary).

    In AtoM, the fonds is by default the highest :term:`level
    of description`. This default can be changed by :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` (see :ref:`User interface labels
    <user-interface-labels>`).

  Function
    A function is a type of entity that describes activities linked to
    records creation, maintenance and use. The International Council on
    Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) defines a function as "Any
    high level purpose, responsibility or task assigned to the
    accountability agenda of a corporate body by legislation, policy or
    mandate. Functions may be decomposed into sets of coordinated
    operations such as subfunctions, business processes, activities, tasks
    or transactions" (ISDF Glossary).

    Functions in AtoM are linked to :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>` and other
    functions. In AtoM the :term:`fields <field>` for describing functions
    are taken from the ICA's International Standard for Describing
    Functions (ISDF). See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`
    and :ref:`functions`.

  Group profile
    A "Group" profile is information about a user group in AtoM. The following 4
    :term:`user roles <user role>` are established as default "Groups" in AtoM
    and each contain their own Group profile: :term:`Administrator`;
    :term:`Editor`; :term:`Contributor`; and :term:`Translator`
    (see: :ref:`user-roles`). Additional Group profiles can also be created and
    maintained by authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrators
    <administrator>`. See: :ref:`manage-user-accounts`.

  Header bar
    The header bar is the navigational tool at the top of all pages in
    AtoM. It includes the :term:`search box`, :term:`browse menu`, and
    :term:`site logo` for all users, and the
    :term:`main menu` for authenticated (i.e. logged in) users. See:
    :ref:`atom-header-bar`.

  Hex color code
    A hexadecimal color code is a method of expressing web based colors using
    hexadecimal notation. Hexadecimal notation is a positional numerical
    system that uses a base of 16 distinct symbols (0-9 to represent values
    zero to nine, A-F to represent values ten to fifteen) to represent binary
    notation in a more human-readable manner. In a hex color code, 6
    consecutive symbols (a hex triplet) are used to represent the red, green,
    and blue (RGB) components of a color - the first 2 symbols represent the
    red value, the next two (3 and 4) represent the green value, and the last
    two (5 and 6) represent the blue value. Each hex triplet has a value
    range between 00 and FF, and when added together, a hex color code can
    represent a total of 16,777,216 colors. For example, pure black is
    represented in hex color code as 00 00 00 or `#000000`, while pure white
    is represented as FF FF FF or `#ffffff`. Hex color codes are often used in
    HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent web colors.
    In AtoM, a user can enter a hex color code when choosing a background
    color for an :term:`archival institution`. See:
    :ref:`change-institution-background`.

  Hierarchy browser
    The hierarchy browser is a :term:`user interface` element that can be
    enabled or disabled by an :term:`administrator` via the :term:`treeview`
    settings page. When enabled, it provides users with a full-width treeview
    of all of AtoM's :term:`archival description` :term:`holdings`. Users can
    expand and collapse individual nodes to explore the hierarchical arrangement
    of a specific :term:`archival unit`; however, clicking any node in the
    hierarchy browser will redirect the user to the related description's
    :term:`view page`. See: :ref:`browse-hierarchy-browser` and
    :ref:`treeview-settings`.

  Holdings
    Holdings is a generic term referring to the :term:`records <record>`
    and other materials held by :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`. In AtoM a list of holdings is displayed in the
    :term:`context menu` on :term:`archival institution` :term:`view pages
    <view page>`. The list is generated from the titles of :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>` that have the :term:`archival
    institution` selected as a :term:`repository`. See :ref:`context-menu`,
    :ref:`archival-institutions` and :ref:`browse-holdings`.

  Home page
    The home page is the first page the user sees when opening the AtoM
    application. It can also be accessed by clicking the site logo. The
    content of the home page can be edited by :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` (see :ref:`home-page` and :ref:`manage-static-pages`).

  Information area
    Information areas appear on :term:`view pages <view page>`
    and :term:`edit pages <edit page>` of any standards-based description
    template in AtoM, and group related :term:`fields <field>` based on the
    organization of elements of description in `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__ (or
    other supported) descriptive standards. They are comprised of a number of
    :term:`fields <field>` in the body of the information area, and an
    :term:`area header`, whose name is drawn from the related area or section of
    the standard upon which the descriptive template is based.

    Clicking on the :term:`area header` of an information area toggles it
    between closed (all fields in that area hidden) and open (all fields
    visible) when in :term:`edit mode`; in :term:`view mode`, clicking on an
    :term:`area header` will result in opening the related information area in
    :term:`edit mode` (if the user is logged in and has sufficient
    :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` to edit a record). For more
    information and a screenshot, see: :ref:`recurring-information-areas`.

  Information object
    An information object is another term for an :term:`archival
    description` that can be more broadly applied to any description of a
    resource, not necessarily archival in origin.

  Institution block
    An element of the Institutional scoping setting (found in **Admin > Settings
    > Global**), this :term:`user interface` element comprises of a
    :term:`repository` logo, dedicated search box, and dedicated browse menu
    that will return search or browse pages related to the :term:`holdings` of a
    particular institution. When enabled, the institution block appears on the
    :term:`view page` of a repository, as well as any search or browse page that
    has been filtered (i.e. "scoped") to a particular
    :term:`archival institution`. For more information, see: :ref:`enable-scoping`.

  Job
    In AtoM, a job refers to a set of operations requested by a user that are
    performed asynchronously in the background, rather than via the web browser,
    to guarantee that web requests are handled promptly and work loads can be
    distributed across multiple machines. This ensures time and/or
    resource-intensive tasks do not timeout when running via the web browser.
    Example asynchronous jobs in AtoM include generating finding aids, managing
    PREMIS rights inheritance, and uploading DIPs from
    `Archivematica <https://www.archivematica.org>`__. Jobs in AtoM are handled
    by `Gearman <http://gearman.org>`__, and the status of AtoM jobs can be seen
    in the :term:`user interface` via the **Manage > Jobs** page. For more
    information, see: :ref:`manage-jobs` and :ref:`maintenance-asynchronous-jobs`.

  Language menu
    The language menu, located in the top-right corner of the page, allows
    the user to switch to any of the :term:`supported languages <supported
    language>` in AtoM. See :ref:`Choose language <choose-language>`; see also
    :ref:`Default language <default-language>` and
    :ref:`Add/remove languages <add-remove-languages>` .

  Level of description
    The level of description is "the position of the unit of description
    in the hierarchy of the :term:`fonds`" (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, the
    level of description is selected from a :term:`value list` in the
    :term:`edit page` of an :term:`archival description`. See: :ref:`data-entry`.
    Level of description values are maintained as :term:`terms <term>` in a
    :term:`taxonomy` - AtoM ships with a number of common archival default
    values, but these can be edited or deleted, and new values can be added
    by authorized users. See: :ref:`terms`.

  Main menu
    The main menu is the the navigational tool located at the top of all
    pages for authenticated  (logged in) users, as part of the
    :term:`header bar`. It allows the user to navigate to all the main
    areas of AtoM. See: :ref:`main-menu`

  Master digital object
    The master digital object is the unaltered version of a :term:`digital
    object` that has been uploaded to AtoM. AtoM automatically generates a
    :term:`thumbnail` and a :term:`reference display copy` of the object.
    Only authenticated users may view master digital objects. See
    :ref:`upload-digital-object`.

  Media type
    Media type refers to the format of uploaded :term:`digital objects
    <digital object>`. The media type is selected automatically by AtoM
    when a :term:`digital object` is uploaded and the :term:`thumbnail`
    and :term:`reference display copies <reference display copy>` of the
    object are generated. See :ref:`upload-digital-object`.

    .. NOTE::

       Media type terms are controlled by the media type :term:`taxonomy`.
       AtoM ships with five :term:`terms <term>` (audio, image, text,
       video, other) that are locked; these cannot be edited or deleted
       because they are referenced by AtoM's code. :term:`Editors
       <editor>` and :term:`administrators <administrator>` can add new
       :term:`media type` terms, but unless :term:`developers <developer>`
       incorporate these into the code, the system will not be able to do
       anything with them.

  Multi-repository system
    A multi-repository system exists when a single instance of AtoM is
    used by a :term:`network` of :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>` or other types of :term:`repositories <repository>`.

  Multi-value field
    A multi-value field is a :term:`field` that is structured to contain
    more than one data entry.

  Name
    In AtoM, names are registered in :term:`authority records <authority
    record>` for :term:`corporate bodies <corporate body>`, persons, and
    families who interact with archival materials as e.g. :term:`creators
    <creator>`, custodians and publishers. Names can be applied as
    :term:`access points <access point>` to :term:`archival descriptions
    <archival description>`. See :ref:`terms`; see also
    :ref:`authority-records` and :ref:`term-name-vs-subject`.

  Network
    A network is an aggregation of institutions using one instance of AtoM
    to produce a union list of archival holdings (a
    :term:`multi-repository system`).

  Parent record
    The parent record refers to the description of the :term:`archival
    unit` that is one :term:`level of description` higher than the current
    unit. For example, a :term:`fonds` may be the parent record of a
    series. A parent record may have multiple :term:`child records
    <child record>`. :term:`Terms <term>` can also be organized hierarchically
    (with parent-child relationships) in a :term:`taxonomy`, and expressed as
    broader or narrower terms. A broader term would be the parent of its
    narrower child terms. See also: :term:`Child record`.

  Password
    A password is a case-sensitive, unspaced string of characters (alpha-
    numeric and/or special characters) associated with a :term:`user
    account` and intended to be kept private, to provide a user with a
    secure means of logging into the AtoM application. Passwords are
    required by every user of the system who needs to be able to add,
    edit, delete, or translate content. The initial passwords are set by
    the system :term:`administrator` (see :ref:`manage-user-accounts`) and
    can subsequently be changed by the user (see :ref:`change-password`).
    System administrators can also change user passwords via the command-line
    - see: :ref:`cli-change-password`.

  Permissions tab
    In AtoM, permissions tabs can be viewed by navigating through :term:`user
    profiles <user profile>` and :term:`group profiles <group profile>`. An
    administrator can view and maintain user and group :term:`access privileges
    <access privilege>` by navigating through these tabs. When editing a user's
    access privileges, these tabs will appear under the user's name as follows:
    "Archival description permissions"; "Authority records permissions";
    "Taxonomy permissions"; and "Archival institution permissions". When editing
    a group's access privileges, these tabs will appear under the user group's
    name as follows: "Information object permissions"; "Actor permissions";
    "Taxonomy permissions"; and "Archival institution permissions".
    See: :ref:`Edit user permissions <edit-user-permissions>`.

  Physical storage
    Physical storage is a grouping of :term:`fields <field>` relating to
    the management of physical objects such as folders, boxes, shelves,
    and cabinets. In AtoM, users can create and edit information about
    physical objects by clicking on the "Link physical storage" option, found
    under the "More" menu in the :term:`button block` of an
    :term:`archival description` or :term:`accession record`. See
    :ref:`Physical storage <physical-storage>`.

  Place
    In AtoM, a place is a geographic location registered in a
    :term:`taxonomy` and used as an :term:`access point` in
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, and :term:`archival institutions
    <archival institution>`. See: :ref:`terms` and :ref:`add-term-fly`.

  Print icon
    An icon of a printer is located in the :term:`title bar` of the View
    Physical storage and Search/Advanced Search results screen. Clicking
    the icon will take the user to a print preview page (simple black and
    white). Go to the browser tabs and select file, from the drop-down list select print. See :ref:`Reports/printing <reports-printing>`.

  Publication status
    The publication status of a record, which can be set to either :term:`draft
    <draft record>` or :term:`published <published record>`, determines whether
    or not the associated description is visible to unauthenticated (i.e., not
    logged in) users, such as :term:`researchers <researcher>`. It can be
    changed in the :term:`administration area` of a description's :term:`edit
    page` by a user with edit permissions. See: :ref:`publish-archival-description`.

  Published record
    A published record is an :term:`archival description` that has had its
    status changed from draft to published in the :term:`Administration
    area <administration area>` at the bottom of the :term:`archival
    description` :term:`edit page`. See: :ref:`publish-archival-description`.

    .. NOTE::

       The publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level
       of description`; e.g. when a :term:`fonds` description is changed
       from draft to published, all :term:`child records <child record>`
       within the fonds are automatically changed as well. Once archival
       descriptions have been published, users who are not logged in can
       view them. See :ref:`publish-archival-description`.

  Quick links menu
    The quick links menu, located in the :term:`header bar` in the top-right
    corner of the page, allows users to navigate to :term:`static pages
    <static page>` and/or other external links added to the application by an
    :term:`administrator`. See: :ref:`quick-links-menu`.

  Radio button
    A radio button is an element of a :term:`user interface` that allows a
    user to select only one of a predefined list of options. Radio buttons
    are used throughout the AtoM application, including in the **Admin >
    Themes** page to select a theme, and in the **Admin > Settings** page to
    control a number of different options.

  Record
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines a record as "recorded information in any form or medium,
    created or received and maintained, by an organization or person in
    the transaction of business or the conduct of affairs" (ISAD
    glossary).

    The Society of American Archivists (`SAA
    <http://www2.archivists.org/>`_), which maintains an excellent
    glossary of `archival terminology
    <http://www2.archivists.org/glossary>`_, holds several different
    definitions of a record, including: "data or information in a fixed
    form that is created or received in the course of individual or
    institutional activity and set aside (preserved) as evidence of that
    activity for future reference."

    In AtoM, an :term:`archival description` is used to provide contextual
    information about and intellectual control over archival materials,
    which include records. See: :ref:`archival-descriptions`.

  Reference code
    In AtoM, a reference code is a unique identifier string associated with an
    :term:`archival description`, created through the combination of inherited
    identifiers from other related entities. This unique string is built using
    the archival description identifier plus the identifier of all its ancestors
    (:term:`parent records <parent record>`), as well as the related
    repository identifier and country code if they have been entered. The
    string will appear in this order with the applicable elements:

    * Country code (derived from the country code of the country entered into the
      contact information of the related :term:`archival institution`)
    * Repository identifier (derived from the identifier field on the related
      :term:`archival institution`)
    * Fonds/Collection level identifier
    * Series identifier
    * Subseries identifier
    * File identifier
    * Item identifier

    The display of either the full inherited reference code, or only the
    identifier associated with the current description, is managed by a
    setting available to an :term:`administrator` in **Admin > Settings >
    Global**. For more information, see: :ref:`inherit-reference-code`.

  Reference display copy
    A reference display copy is a low-resolution version of a
    :term:`master digital object` generated automatically by AtoM on
    upload. It is used to display images on the :term:`digital object`
    :term:`view page` when the user clicks on a :term:`thumbnail`, on
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` that have linked
    digital objects, and in the digital object area of :term:`edit pages
    <edit page>`. See See :ref:`upload-digital-object`.

  Report icon
    In AtoM a report icon can be found in the right hand :term:`context
    menu` of an :term:`archival description` :term:`view page`. Clicking
    on the report icon takes the user to a Reports screen and the choice
    of printing 4 different reports: File list, Item list, :term:`Physical
    storage <physical storage>` locations, or a set of Box labels. See
    :ref:`Reports/printing <reports-printing>`.

  Repository
    The Society of American Archivists `Glossary
    <http://www2.archivists.org/glossary>`__ defines a repository as "any
    type of organization that holds documents, including business,
    institutional, and government archives, manuscript collections,
    libraries, museums, and historical societies, and in any form,
    including manuscripts, photographs, moving image and sound materials,
    and their electronic equivalents."

    In AtoM, the term is sometimes used as a more generic term for
    :term:`archival institution` that includes all cultural heritage
    organizations. For instructions on working with repositories in AtoM,
    see: :ref:`archival-institutions`.

  Researcher
    A researcher is a type of user who is limited to searching and
    browsing descriptions. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` and
    :ref:`researcher-default`.

  Rights record
    In AtoM, Rights records can be linked to :term:`accession records
    <accession record>`, :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>` and :term:`digital objects <digital object>`. AtoM
    Rights metadata elements use `PREMIS rights elements
    <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/>`_. In AtoM restrictions can be
    based on Copyright(s), License, Statute(s) and Policy. For a full
    explanation see :ref:`rights`.

  Search box
    The search box is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text
    matching a search query. The search box is located in the
    :term:`header bar` on all AtoM pages, including the home page. See
    :ref:`Access content <access-content>` and :ref:`search-atom`

  Self-reciprocal term
    A :term:`term` that has an inverse reciprocal relationship to another
    term in the same :term:`taxonomy` is known as a :term:`converse term`. A
    self-reciprocal term, in contrast, is one whose inverse reciprocal term is
    itself. Converse  and self-reciprocal term relationships can be managed
    via the term's :term:`edit page`; currently converse and self-reciprocal
    relationships  are only used in the Actor relations taxonomy, though the
    field is available in all term edit pages. Examples of default converse
    terms include: *is the parent of* and *is the child of*, or *is the employer
    of* and *is the employee of*, while examples of a default self-reciprocal
    terms include *is the sibling of* and *is the associate of*. Actor relation
    :term:`terms <term>` are used in the ISAAR Relationships dialogue to
    establish relationships between :term:`authority records <authority record>`.
    When one term is added as a relationship qualifier to an authority record,
    its converse term will automatically appear on the related authority record.
    Terms marked as self-reciprocal will automatically appear similarly on
    *both* related authority records. For more information, see:
    :ref:`add-converse-term` and :ref:`link-two-authority-records`.

  Setting
    Settings is a broad term used to describe the properties that affect
    the way a program looks and functions. In AtoM, certain settings can
    be changed by an :term:`administrator` in order to customize AtoM to
    institution-specific requirements. See :ref:`settings`.

  Site description
    The site description is a brief description of the site's purpose or
    its contents, that can be optionally included by an
    :term:`administrator` when configuring the :term:`settings <setting>`
    of an AtoM installation. When made visible via AtoM's :ref:`Settings
    <settings>`, the site title appears at the top of the
    page directly under the :term:`header bar`. It is a configurable
    element - the text can be changed or removed. See
    :ref:`Site information <site-information>` and :ref:`Default page
    elements <default-page-elements>`. See also :ref:`atom-header-bar` and
    :ref:`recurring-page-elements`.

  Site base URL
    The site base URL is the absolute URL to your site's homepage. This
    URL will be included in MODS and EAD XML exports to formulate absolute
    links to AtoM resources. If your domain is "townarchives.org", for
    example, your base URL would normally be "http://townarchives.org".

  Site logo
    The site logo is the graphic that appears at the top of all pages in
    the left-hand corner of the :term:`header bar` in AtoM. Clicking on
    the logo will take the user to the :term:`home page`. AtoM ships with
    a default logo that can be replaced by
    :term:`administrators <administrator>` to theme the application to
    their own institution or :term:`network` if desired. See :ref:`Site logo
    <site-logo>`; see also: :ref:`atom-header-bar`. An :term:`administrator`
    can also control via the :ref:`settings` whether or not the logo is
    displayed in the AtoM :term:`header bar` - see: :ref:`default-page-elements`.

  Site title
    The site title is a configurable element in AtoM that can be managed
    by an :term:`administrator` through the application :term:`settings
    <setting>`. The site title will appear in the AtoM :term:`header bar` if it
    is made visible via the Default page elements settings. See
    :ref:`site-information`; see also: :ref:`default-page-elements` and
    :ref:`atom-header-bar`.

  SKOS
    Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a data standard model
    developed by the `World Wide Web Consortium <http://www.w3.org/>`_
    (W3C) as a common data model "for expressing the basic structure and
    content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes,
    subject heading lists, taxonomies, folksonomies, and other similar
    types of controlled vocabulary." (`W3C SKOS Primer, 18 August 2009
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-skos-primer-20090818/>`_). It is used
    in AtoM to import and export hierarchical :term:`taxonomies
    <taxonomy>`. See: :ref:`export-xml`. See also:
    :ref:`terms` and :ref:`import-skos`.

  Slug
    A :term:`slug` is a word or sequence of words which make up the last part
    of a URL in AtoM. It is the part of the URL that uniquely identifies the
    resource and often is indicative of the name or title of the page (e.g.: in
    *www.yourwebpage.com/about*, the slug is *about*). The slug is meant to
    provide a unique, human-readable, permanent link to a resource. In AtoM,
    all pages based on user data (such as :term:`archival descriptions
    <archival description>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`terms
    <term>`, etc.) are automatically assigned a slug based on the title
    (or authorized form of name) of the resource. See :ref:`slugs-in-atom`
    for further details.

    As well, :term:`static pages <static page>`, or permanent links, include a
    slug :term:`field` option, but only slugs for new static pages can be
    edited by users; the slugs for the default :term:`Home page` and
    :term:`About page` in AtoM **cannot** be edited. New static page slugs can
    either be customized by users or automatically generated by AtoM if the
    field is left blank; AtoM will automatically generate a slug that is based
    on the "Title" you have indicated for the new static page.

  Sort button
    The sort button is a navigational element that appears on some browse and
    search pages throughout AtoM. It allows a user to change the sort order of
    the results being displayed, from alphabetic to most recent. When the sort
    order is set to "Alphabetic," results are organized A-Z. When results are
    ordered by "Most recent" the most recently added and/or edited records in
    the results will appear at the top of the list, allowing users to discover
    new or recently updated content. See: :ref:`recurring-sort-button`.

  Static page
    Static pages are pages that are designed to look the same each time
    they are accessed, in contrast to dynamic pages such as,
    :doc:`search pages <../access-content/search-atom>`,
    :term:`view pages <view page>`, or :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.
    AtoM has two static pages, the :term:`home page` and the
    :term:`about page`. Static pages can be edited by an
    :term:`administrator`, and new static pages can be created.
    (see :ref:`Manage static pages <manage-static-pages>`; see
    also: :ref:`quick-links-menu`).

  Subject
    In AtoM, subjects are :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled
    vocabulary>` :term:`terms <term>` grouped in a :term:`taxonomy` and
    used as :term:`access points <access point>` in :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`. See: :ref:`terms`.

  Supported language
    In AtoM, a supported language is one into which both :term:`data
    elements <data element>` and :term:`user interface` elements can be
    translated. See: :ref:`Default language <default-language>`;
    see also: :ref:`translate`.

  Taxonomy
    A taxonomy is a grouping of :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled
    vocabulary>` :term:`terms <term>` used to generate :term:`value lists
    <value list>` and :term:`access points <access point>`. See
    :ref:`terms`.

  Term
    Terms are the values that make up :term:`controlled vocabularies
    <controlled vocabulary>`. In AtoM, terms are grouped into
    :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` that can be added, edited, and deleted
    through the "Term" item of the add menu. See :ref:`terms`.

  Thumbnail
    A thumbnail is a small, low-resolution version of a :term:`master
    digital object` generated automatically by AtoM on upload. Thumbnails
    are displayed in search and browse results and in :term:`carousel`
    views at higher :term:`levels of description <level of description>`.
    See :ref:`upload-digital-object` and :ref:`File formats <file-formats>`.

  Title bar
    The :term:`title bar` is a contextual element that appears throughout AtoM
    on various different :ref:`page types <page-types>`, offering the user an
    indication of the type of page, and/or the name of the record, currently
    being viewed. On a :term:`view <view page>` or :term:`edit <edit page>`
    page, the :term:`title bar` displays the name (title) of the current entity.
    The title bar appears at the top of core :ref:`entity <entity-types>`
    records in AtoM, including :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`,
    :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions
    <function>`, and :term:`terms <term>` (such as :term:`subjects <subject>`
    and :term:`places <place>`), as well as at the top of :term:`physical
    storage` locations. On Donor and :term:`accession <accession record>`
    records, the title bar displays a message indicating whether the record
    is in :term:`view <view mode>` or :term:`edit <edit mode>` mode, with the
    record's name/title display below (as a sub-title). On :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, the title bar also displays the
    :term:`level of description` of the displayed description. See:
    :ref:`Title bar <recurring-title-bar>`.

  Tooltips
    Tooltips are online text designed to assist users to enter data in
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. Tooltip text is usually derived from
    the standards on which the edit templates are based; in rare occasions
    where the :term:`field` does not correspond directly to a standard,
    this text has been supplied. Note that :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` can turn tooltips on or off. See :ref:`Global settings
    <global-settings>`.

  Top-level description filter
    The top-level description filter appears on the search and browse pages for
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. It limits the returned
    results to those descriptions without any :term:`parents <parent record>` -
    that is, those that are not part of a hierarchy with any records higher than
    them in the hierarchy. By default, the filter is engaged on the browse page
    for archival descriptions, and disengaged by default on the search results
    page - but users can manually set the filter setting via the
    :term:`radio button` above the Levels of description :term:`facet filter`.
    See: :ref:`browse-descriptions`


  Translation bar
    The translation bar appears at the bottom of the page when users with
    :term:`translator` :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` select
    a language from the :term:`language menu`. Clicking on "Translate user
    interface" in the bottom right-hand corner of the bar opens up the
    :term:`translation panel`, where the user translates :term:`user
    interface` elements. See :ref:`Translate <translate>`.

  Translation panel
    The translation panel is used by :term:`translators <translator>` to edit
    :term:`user interface` elements and is accessed via the
    :term:`translation bar`. See :ref:`translate-interface`.

  Translator
    A translator is a type of user who can translate :term:`data elements
    <data element>` and :term:`user interface` elements. See :ref:`user-roles`;
    see also: :ref:`translator-default` and :ref:`translate`.

  Treeview
    The treeview is a contextual and navigation element located in the
    :term:`context menu` for :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`places <place>`, and :term:`subjects <subject>`. It
    shows the current record's relationships to other records, with links,
    e.g. the hierarchical placement of :term:`archival descriptions
    <archival description>` within a :term:`fonds`, or the hierarchical
    placement of a :term:`term` (such as a :term:`subject` or :term:`place`)
    within a :term:`taxonomy`. The treeview can also be used for navigation.
    See: :ref:`Context menu <context-menu>`.

  Typeahead
    Typeahead (also known as incremental search or real-time suggestions) is a
    form of auto-complete used in a :term:`user interface`. As a user enters
    text, one or more possible matches are found and presented to the user,
    which continue to narrow as a user enters further text.
    This allows a user to dynamically view results and select a
    resource without necessarily having to enter its full name or title. In
    AtoM, the :term:`search box` implements typeahead, and presents the user
    with results divided into :ref:`entity types <entity-types>` such as
    :term:`archival description`, :term:`authority record`, :term:`archival
    institution`, :term:`subject`, and :term:`place`. It appears as a
    :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` below the :term:`search box` as a user
    enters text. See: :ref:`search-atom` and :ref:`search-box`.

  User account
    User accounts are established in order to manage :term:`access
    privileges <access privilege>` through the assignment of :term:`user
    roles <user role>`. Every user who must be able to add, edit, delete,
    or translate content must have a user account. In AtoM user accounts
    are established and maintained by :term:`administrators <administrator>`.
    See :ref:`user-roles`, :ref:`manage-user-accounts`, and
    :ref:`edit-user-permissions`.

  User interface
    The user interface is the set of elements that allow the user to
    interact with the AtoM application. These elements include the :
    :term:`main menu`, :term:`drop-down menus <drop-down menu>`,
    :term:`context menu`, :term:`title bar`, :term:`column headers <column
    header>`, buttons and :term:`button block`, :term:`fields <field>`, and
    :term:`field labels <field label>`, and any other elements used to
    navigate AtoM or to search for, view, add, edit, and delete
    :term:`database content`. The labels of some user interface elements
    can be customized by :term:`administrators <administrator>` (see
    :ref:`User interface labels <user-interface-labels>`).

  Username
    The username is a name supplied by an :term:`administrator` to any
    user (other than a :term:`researcher`) of the AtoM application as part
    of the :term:`user account`. See :ref:`manage-user-accounts`.

  User profile
    A user profile is information about a user managed in a :term:`user
    account`. User profiles are created and maintained by
    :term:`administrators  <administrator>` (see :ref:`manage-user-accounts`),
    although authenticated (i.e., logged in) users can view their own profiles
    (and change their :term:`passwords <password>`) by going through the
    :term:`header bar` (see: :ref:`Change password <change-password>`). See:
    :ref:`manage-user-accounts`.

  User role
    User roles define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from
    view-only access to full administration rights. User roles are defined
    by groups that an :term:`administrator` can add and edit. See
    :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`, :ref:`manage-user-accounts`, and
    :ref:`edit-user-permissions`.

  Value list
    Value lists restrict data entry in certain :term:`fields <field>` to
    :term:`controlled vocabulary` :term:`terms <term>` or terms derived
    from :term:`authority records <authority record>`. They appear as
    :term:`drop-down menus <drop-down menu>` in :term:`edit pages
    <edit page>`.

  View mode
    View mode provides read-only access to the contents of :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records
    <authority record>`, :term:`functions <function>` and :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>` using :term:`view pages <view
    page>`. In view mode, AtoM displays only those :term:`fields <field>`
    in a :term:`record` which contain data.

  View page
    View pages allow users to view in detail the contents of
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, :term:`functions <function>` and
    :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`.

  Visible elements
    Visible elements enables an :term:`administrator` to "hide" specific
    :term:`fields <field>` in the database from the public (i.e.,
    unauthorized users, or users who are not logged in). To review which
    fields can be hidden from view, select ISAD template, RAD template,
    Digital object metadata area, and/or Physical Storage. The
    :term:`administrator` can click on the checkboxes to reveal the field,
    while an unchecked box hides the field. See :ref:`Visible elements
    <visible-elements>`.
