Archival Institutions

:term:`Archival institutions <archival institution>` are one of the core
:doc:`entity types <../overview/entity-types>` in AtoM and provide users with
the means of managing information about :term:`repositories <repository>`
and other institutions and organizations that hold archival materials or
other cultural heritage items and artifacts.

In AtoM, :term:`archival institution` descriptions are structured into
:term:`information areas <information area>` based on the `ICA's
<http://www.ica.org/>`__ *International Standard for
Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings* (:ref:`ISDIAH
<isdiah-template>`). The ISDIAH glossary describes an archival institution as:
*"An organization which keeps and preserves archival material and makes it
accessible to the public."* While generally targeted at institutions whose
primary function is to collect and keep archives and make them publicly
available, the ISDIAH introduction goes on to note that:


    *...other entities such as cultural institutions (libraries, museums),
    businesses, families or individuals may hold archives. This standard, or
    an appropriate subset of its elements, can be applied to all entities
    which provide access to the records they hold.*

Information captured in the :term:`archival institution` description template
is comprehensive, but relates specifically to the :term:`repository's
<repository>` role collecting and providing access to cultural heritage
materials. In addition to capturing identity and history information, the
ISDIAH standard provides information areas to record information about
collection policies,services offered, buildings, accessibility, and more.
Consequently, the :term:`archival institution` record should be considered
distinct from, but complementary to, that of an :term:`authority record`. The
ISDIAH Introduction notes that:

    *As corporate bodies, persons or families, the holders of archival
    materials may be described in ISAAR(CPF) compliant authority records
    including the appropriate elements of description as indicated in ISDIAH.
    Otherwise, the description of holders may be included in separate
    authority files.*

In **AtoM**, :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` can be linked
to :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` and the holdings of an
institution can be browsed even when AtoM is used as a :term:`multi-repository
system`. On all related :term:`archival description` :term:`view pages <view
page>`, the institution's name and logo will appear as hyperlinks to the
:term:`archival institution` record; similarly, an archival institution's page
will list its holdings as hyperlinks to related archival descriptions.
Institutions can also be themed in AtoM - when a background color is added to
the :term:`archival institution`, the same background color will appear behind
all related :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` to highlight
the relationship.

.. _add-archival-institution:

Add a new archival institution
==============================

This section contains instructions on how to Add a new :term:`archival
institution` in AtoM. There are three
main ways to add an archival institution record in AtoM - doing so via the
|plus| :ref:`"Add" <main-menu-add>` menu is the easiest, but to accommodate
different workflows, archival institution records can also be added from an
:term:`archival description` or from the :term:`view page` of another archival
institution. Below are instructions to add a new archival institution:

* :ref:`From the Add menu <add-institution-main>`
* :ref:`From the archival description edit page
  <add-institution-description-edit>`
* :ref:`From the archival institution view page <add-institution-view>`.

For specific information on the :term:`fields <field>` in the archival
institution's :term:`edit page`, see: :ref:`ISDIAH template
<isdiah-template>`

.. _add-institution-main:

Add a new archival institution from the main menu
-------------------------------------------------

.. |plus| image:: images/plus-sign.png
   :height: 18
   :width: 18

.. |pencil| image:: images/edit-sign.png
   :height: 18
   :width: 18

A new archival institution can be added at any time, from anywhere in the
application, via the :term:`main menu`.

.. NOTE::

   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` must be logged-in in order to add
   a new :term:`archival institution`. For more information on logging in,
   see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` for more
   information on groups and default permissions in AtoM.

**To create a new archival institution:**

1. In the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`, click the |plus|
   :ref:`"Add" <main-menu-add>` menu and select "Archival institution" from the
   :term:`drop-down menu`.
2. AtoM takes you to a blank :term:`edit page` for data entry.

.. image:: images/new-archival-institution.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of a new archival institution edit page

3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   :term:`information area` to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under
   it. Enter data as required.
4. You can quit the process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button in the
   :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be saved and no new
   record will be added. Note that simply navigating away from the page by any
   other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will also result in no new
   record being created.
5. To save a new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <Create button>`
   in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

.. image:: images/button-block-create.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Click create to save your new archival institution

Once the new :term:`archival institution` is saved, you will be redirected to
the recordâ€™s :term:`view page`, where you can review your work. Clicking "Edit"
in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record will re-open the
archival institution in :term:`edit mode`.

.. _add-institution-description-edit:

Add a new archival institution from an archival description edit page
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A new archival institution can be generated from an :term:`archival description`
record at any time; it does not first have to be created separately.

An :term:`archival institution` can be added via a value list that appears in a
:term:`drop-down menu` - as you type data into the "Repository" :term:`field`,
the value list will narrow its options to present related suggestions. If the
archival institution already exists, you can select the name from the values and
a link will be created.

If the archival institution does not already exist, however, new names can be
added "on the fly" by typing and entering the name of the archival institution
in the designated :term:`field`; an archival institution record will be
automatically created once you click the :term:`"Create" button <Create button>`
in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

Whenever a new :term:`archival institution` is added to an :term:`archival
description`, a new record for that name will be generated when the archival
description is saved. Because each edit template uses different labels for the
:term:`field` to add a new archival institution, template specific instructions
have been included below.

**ISAD(G) edit template**

* In the "Context area" :term:`information area` of the :ref:`ISAD(G) template
  <isad-template>`, navigate to the "Repository" :term:`field` and enter a new
  name.
* The name will be saved as a new archival institution when you save the
  archival description.

**Rules for Archival Description (RAD) edit template**

* In the "Title and statement of responsibility area" :term:`information area`
  of the :ref:`RAD template <rad-template>`, navigate to the "Repository"
  :term:`field` and enter a new institution name.
* The name will be saved as a new archival institution when you save the
  archival description.

**Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) edit template**

* In the "Identity elements" :term:`information area` of the :ref:`DACS template
  <dacs-template>`, navigate to the "Name and location of repository"
  :term:`field` and enter a new name.
* The name will be saved as a new archival institution when you save the
  archival description.

**Dublin Core Version 1.1 (DC) edit template**

* In the "Elements area" :term:`information area` of the :ref:`Dublin Core
  template <dc-template>`, navigate to the "Relation(isLocatedAt)" :term:`field`
  and enter a new name.
* The name will be saved as a new archival institution when you save the
  archival description.

**Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) edit template**

* In the "Elements area" :term:`information area` of the :ref:`MODS template
  <mods-template>`, navigate to the "Repository" :term:`field` and enter a new
  name.
* The name will be saved as a new archival institution when you save the
  archival description.

The newly created archival institution will then have to be edited to include
necessary data. To edit the archival institution record, see the :ref:`Edit an
existing archival institution <edit-archival-institution>` section of this page.


.. _add-institution-view:

Add a new archival institution from the view page
-------------------------------------------------

A new :term:`archival institution` can also be added to AtoM from the
:term:`view page` of any other archival institution via the :term:`Add new
button` in the :term:`button block`. To do so:

1.  Navigate to an existing :term:`archival institution` in AtoM. You can do
    this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or by
    :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for a specific archival
    institution - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for
    more information on navigation in AtoM.
2.  At the bottom of the archival institution :term:`view page`, you will see
    the :term:`button block` with several options (Edit, Delete, and Add new).
    Click the :term:`Add new button`.

.. image:: images/button-block-institution.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Click Add new to create a new repository

3.  AtoM takes you to a blank :term:`edit page` for data entry. On loading, the
    edit page displays the record with all :term:`information areas
    <information area>` closed; click on an information area to access the
    :term:`fields<field>` grouped under it. Enter data as required.

.. image:: images/new-archival-institution.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of a new archival institution edit page

4.  You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel"
    button in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be
    saved, and no new record will be created. Note that simply navigating away
    from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
    also result in no new record being created.
5.  To save the new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <Create button>`
    located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

.. image:: images/button-block-create.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Click create to save your new archival institution

Once the new :term:`archival institution` is saved, you will be redirected to
the recordâ€™s :term:`view page`, where you can review your work. Clicking "Edit"
in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record will re-open the
archival institution in :term:`edit mode`.

:ref:`Back to top <archival-institutions>`

.. _edit-archival-institution:

Edit an existing archival institution
=====================================

This section contains instructions on how to edit an existing :term:`archival
institution`, after it has been :ref:`created <add-archival-institution>`.
For information on how to theme your archival institution, see :ref:`below
<edit-institution-theme>`.

.. NOTE::
   Only an authenticated (i.e. logged in) :term:`administrator` user can edit or
   update an archival institution. For more information on edit privileges and
   user roles see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

An archival institution's description can be edited at any time.

**To edit an existing archival institution:**

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival institution` you wish to edit. You can
   do this by :ref:`browsing <browse>` or :ref:`searching <search-atom>` for the
   :term:`archival institution` by name. See
   :ref:`access content <access-content>` for more information on navigation in
   AtoM.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking the
   :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button block` located at
   the bottom of the record, or by clicking on one of the :term:`information
   area` headings; this takes you to the record's :term:`edit page`.

.. image:: images/button-block-institution.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Click create to save your new archival institution

3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   information area to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under it.

.. image:: images/new-archival-institution.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: On loading, all information areas are closed; click one to expand

4. Add and/or revise data as required. See :ref:`ISDIAH template
   <isdiah-template>` for field-specific guidance.
5. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the
   archival institution.
6. To save your edits, click the "Save" button located in the :term:`button
   block` at the bottom of the record.

.. image:: images/button-block-save.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Click to save your new archival institution

You will be redirected to the :term:`view page` for the edited :term:`archival
institution`, where you can review your work.

:ref:`Back to top <archival-institutions>`

.. _institution-access-points:

Add access points to your archival institution
==============================================

To improve browsing in a :term:`multi-repository system` and to enhance the
information available to end-users about your institution, you can add custom
:term:`access points <access point>` to your :term:`archival institution` via
the :term:`edit page` of your repository.

AtoM includes 5 :term:`facets <facet filter>` drawn from data added to your
archival institution:

* **Archive type:** Limits results to those with a type matching data in the
  "Type" :term:`field` in the Identity :term:`area <information area>` of the
  :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` archival institution edit template
* **Geographic region:** Limits results to those matching data entered into the
  "Region/province" :term:`field` in the physical location tab of the contact
  dialogue (available in the "Contact" :term:`area <information area>` of the
  :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` archival institution edit template)
* **Geographic subregion:** Limits results to those institutions with a
  matching :term:`access point` added to the "Geographic subregion"
  :term:`field` in the Access points :term:`area <information area>` of the
  :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` archival institution record
* **Locality:** Limits results to those matching data entered into the
  "City" (e.g. city, town, etc) :term:`field` in the physical location tab
  of the contact dialogue (available in the "Contact"
  :term:`area <information area>` of the :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>`
  archival institution edit template)
* **Thematic area:** Limits results to those institutions with a
  matching :term:`access point` added to the "Thematic area" :term:`field` in the
  Access points :term:`area <information area>` of the
  :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` archival institution record

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`browse`
   * :ref:`recurring-facet-filters`

The **Geographic region** and **Locality** facets are automatically populated
based on data entered into the contact information fields available in the
Contact :term:`area <information area>` of the archival institution
:term:`edit page`, and the **Archive type** facet is similarly automatically
populated based on data entered into the "Type" :term:`field` in the Identity
:term:`area <information area>`.

.. image:: images/repo-contact-facets.png
   :align: center
   :width: 40%
   :alt: An image of the Contact information fields that will populate facets

The **Geographic subregion** and **Thematic area** facets are managed as
:term:`access points <access point>`, and must be manually added in the
Access points :term:`area <information area>` of the archival institution
:term:`edit page`. Similar to the :term:`place` and :term:`subject` access point
fields available on :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, all
access points included by default or added by users are managed as
:term:`terms <term>` in a :term:`taxonomy`, which users can manage directly via
|pencil| **Manage > Taxonomies**. For more information on working with terms and
taxonomies in AtoM, see: :ref:`terms`.

The **Geographic subregion** access point is intended to support better regional
browsing in a :term:`multi-repository system`, especially in state, regional,
or provincial union catalogues or :term:`networks <network>` where Region is
not specific  enough. For example, *Southern Alberta*, *Northern Alberta*, and
*Central Alberta* might be terms used in a province-wide union catalogue for
Alberta, a province in Canada. AtoM does not include any default terms in
this taxonomy. Users can add new terms directly to the taxonomy (see:
:ref:`add-term-taxonomy`), or by entering new terms to the Geographic
subregion field in the archival institution edit template (instructions on how
to do this below).

The **Thematic area** access point is intended to assist users in identifying
major collecting areas of an archival institution by offering them a sense of
the subject matter addressed in the :term:`holdings` of the institution. AtoM
includes a number of default terms (included in both French and English) in
the Thematic area :term:`taxonomy`, derived from the terms used in the
Canadian Council of Archives' Directory of Archives:

.. figure:: images/CCA-Directory-Archives-terms.*

   :alt: An image of CCA's Directory of Archives

   An image of the CCA's Directory of Archives, showing the Theme terms that
   were used to create the default terms in AtoM's Thematic area taxonomy.

All default *Thematic area* terms can be edited or deleted by users with the
appropriate edit permissions, and new terms can be added directly to the
taxonomy (see: :ref:`add-term-taxonomy`), or by entering new terms to the
Thematic area field in the archival institution edit template (instructions on how
to do this below).

**To add new Geographic subregion or Thematic area access points:**

1. Navigate to the :term:`archival institution` to which you would like to add
   a new :term:`access point`. You can do this either by
   :ref:`searching <search-atom>` or :ref:`browsing <browse>` - for more
   information on navigation in AtoM, see :ref:`access-content`.
2. At the bottom of the archival institution's :term:`view page`, you will see
   the :term:`button block` with several options. Click the "Edit" button, or
   click on any of the information area :term:`headers <area header>`, to enter
   :term:`edit mode`.

.. figure:: images/button-block-institution.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 80%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: An image of the button block on an archival institution

   The button block available on an archival institution

3. Navigate to the Access points :term:`information area` at the bottom of the
   :term:`edit page`, and begin typing  your :term:`access point` into the
   relevant :term:`field`. Wait a moment and do not press enter immediately -
   the access point fields will auto-complete any matching terms in a
   :term:`drop-down menu`, allowing you to see if your access point already
   exists.

.. figure:: images/repo-facet-add.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 80%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: An image of adding an access point to an archival institution

   When you begin typing in an access point field, the drop-down will provide
   matching suggestions - select from the list to use an existing term, or
   enter a new term. Be careful: if you type the full name of an existing
   term and press enter (instead of selecting from the list), you could
   accidentally create a duplicate term!

4. If a matching term *DOES* exist, select from the drop-down list and save
   the :term:`archival institution` by using the "save" button in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the :term:`edit page`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   If you are not careful, it is easy to accidentally create duplicate terms!
   To avoid duplication, matching terms **must** be selected from the
   auto-complete :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` - otherwise, even exact
   matches will create duplicates when the user presses enter.

5. If a matching term does *not* exist, press the Tab key to exit the field,
   or use your cursor. A new term will be created in the related
   :term:`taxonomy` (e.g. Geographic subregion or Thematic area) when the
   archival institution is saved.
6. You can add multiple terms at a time - when you exit the :term:`field` with
   your cursor, AtoM will provide a new blank field. Repeat steps 4-5 as
   necessary. If you need to **edit** or **remove** a term you have just
   added, place your cursor to the left of the term - an **X** icon will
   appear in place of the bullet next to the term. You can click the **X** to
   remove the term.

.. figure:: images/repo-facet-remove.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 80%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: An image of removing an access point

   Place your cursor to the left of a term to see the option to remove it -
   the bullet icon will change to an **X** icon. Click to remove the term.

7. At the bottom of the institution's :term:`edit page`, click the "Save"
   button in the :term:`button block` when you are done editing. AtoM will
   reload the :term:`archival institution` in :term:`view mode`, and your new
   access point(s) will appear in the Access points :term:`information area`.

   saving. Note how each is qualified with the related taxonomy in parentheses
   after the term.

8. Your access points can now be used as :term:`facet filters <facet filter>` on
   the archival institution browse page. For more information see:

   * :ref:`browse`
   * :ref:`recurring-facet-filters`

.. _link-archival-institution:

Link an archival description to an archival institution
=======================================================

Links between existing archival institution and existing archival descriptions
can be added at any time by an authenticated (i.e. logged in)
:term:`administrator` with sufficient edit permissions. For more information on
types of users and edit permissions, see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. You
will need to create the link from the :term:`archival description` you wish
to link.

.. TIP::

   When linking a repository to an archival description, link only at the top
   level of description (e.g. :term:`fonds`, :term:`collection`, etc)- AtoM will
   automatically inherit the repository to lower levels of description (e.g.
   :term:`children <child record>`). If you link at all levels, it can not only
   impact performance, but it will also mean that each lower-level description
   will appear in the :term:`holdings` list, instead of just the
   :term:`parent <parent record>` description. For more on the holdings list,
   see: :ref:`browse-holdings`.

**To link an archival description to an archival institution:**

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival description` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the :term:`archival
   description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.
2.  Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking :term:`"Edit"
    button <edit button>` in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of
    the :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the recordâ€™s
    :term:`edit page`.

.. image:: images/button-block-description.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Click edit to enter edit mode and link your repository

3.  To create a link to an archival institution, follow the steps above for
    :ref:`"adding a new archival institution" <add-institution-main>` - however,
    instead of entering a new name, begin typing the name of the
    :term:`archival institution` to which you would like to create a link. The
    name :term:`field` is an auto-complete - as you type, matching results will
    load in a :term:`drop-down menu` below the field. When you see the
    :term:`archival institution` you would like to link, click on it to select
    it.

.. image:: images/link-repository-autocomplete.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An example of using the autocomplete to link a repository

.. IMPORTANT::

   This method makes use of  an `auto-complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
   /Auto-complete>`__ field to find the right :term:`archival institution` as
   you begin to type its name/title. **Be sure** to pick the record from the
   :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` when it appears - if you type the full
   name and press enter, a new archival institution will be generated
   instead of a link being created to an existing one! If, however, you wish
   to add a new archival institution from the archival description's
   :term:`edit page`, see :ref:`above <add-institution-description-edit>`.

.. _edit-institution-theme:

Edit the theme for an existing archival institution
===================================================

AtoM 2.0 introduces a new design feature for users that allows them to customize
their archival institution's page by adding/editing an institution logo and/or
banner, as well as choose a specific background color for their institution's
page. Once added, the background color and logo will appear on all of the
institution's related :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` (see
:ref:`above <link-archival-institution>` for information on how to create a link
between an :term:`archival description` and an :term:`archival institution`).

Additionally, users can add custom `HTML
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html>`__ and inline `CSS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS>`__ to a description area for specific
highlighted content. These features can be especially useful in a
:term:`multi-repository system` as they help users visually identify where
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` are held, and allow for
an institution in a multi-repository system such a network or
provincial/state portal to better match their institution's local branding.
Editing the theme of your :term:`archival institution` is
comprised of four main elements:

* :ref:`Change the background color <change-institution-background>`
* :ref:`Add/edit a logo <add-institution-logo>`
* :ref:`Add/edit a banner <add-institution-banner>`
* :ref:`Add/edit a custom description <add-institution-custom-content>`
* :ref:`Add a Google map <add-map>`

:ref:`Back to top <archival-institutions>`

.. _change-institution-background:

Change the background color of an archival institution
------------------------------------------------------

This new design feature allows authenticated (i.e. logged in)
:term:`administrators <administrator>` to customize their archival institution
record by changing the background color of the page. Users can choose and
modify (i.e. hue, tint) a color from a pre-determined color palette.
Changing the background color in an archival institution :term:`edit page`
will automatically change the background color of all the :term:`archival
description` pages linked to that specific institution.

**To change the background color of an archival institution page:**

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival institution` whose theme you wish to
   edit. You can do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the :term:`archival
   institution` by name. See :ref:`access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.
2. Click on the "Edit theme" button in the :term:`button block` at the bottom
   of the archival institution's :term:`edit page`.

.. image:: images/edit-theme-button.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of the edit theme button in the button block

3. AtoM will reload load the institutions theme :term:`edit page`. From here,
   authenticated users can change the background color, upload a logo
   and/or banner, and add custom content.

4. In the "Style" area, click on the Background color (you can click on the
   title, the color swatch, or text box showing the :term:`hex color code`).
   A :term:`color picker` will appear as a :term:`drop-down menu`.

   :width: 25%
   :alt: An closeup of the color picker in the Edit Theme page

5. Select the color that you would like to use as the background for your
   :term:`archival institution` record. This color will appear as the
   background for all related :term:`archival descriptions
   <archival description>` as well. Use the slider on the right of the
   :term:`color picker` drop-down to select a **hue** - you can click or drag
   the slider bar to dynamically change the color in the palette. Use the
   palette to select a **tint** - you can click or drag in the palette to
   dynamically change the color. There is also a text-box provided where you
   can manually enter a :term:`hex color code` if you with. The selected
   color will be displayed in the small preview box next to the
   :term:`hex color code` text-box. You can click anywhere outside of the the
   :term:`color picker` to hide the :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>`.
6. You can quit the theming process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the
   archival institution.
7. When you have selected your new background color, click "Save" in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the page. AtoM will reload the
   :term:`archival institution` in :term:`view mode`, where you can review how
   the new color looks. If needed, you can repeat steps 2-6 until you are
   happy with the selection.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Be sure to check the appearance of titles, text, and hyperlinks on your
   :term:`archival institution` page and on any related :term:`archival
   descriptions <archival description>`. Some color choices make decrease
   accessibility, and make titles, text, and hyperlinks harder for users to
   read.

.. _add-map:

Add a Google map to an archival institution
-------------------------------------------

Users can add a Google map to the :term:`view page` for an archival
institution showing the location of the institution. These instructions
require an :term:`administrator` who can make changes to AtoM's settings via
the :term:`user interface`.

.. figure:: images/institution-map.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 90%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Institution view page with Google map

   Institution view page with Google map


1. First, you will need to set up a
   `Google account <https://accounts.google.com>`_ if you do not already
   have one.

2. Next, request an
   `API key <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key>`__
   from Google.

3. Navigate to |gears| **Admin > Settings** and scroll down to near the bottom
   of the Global settings page. Add your Maps API key to the field marked
   "Google Maps JavaScript API key setting." For more information, see:
   :ref:`maps-api-key`. Don't forget to save your settings after making
   changes, using the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the Settings page.

4. Maps will only appear on an institution's :term:`view page` if the latitude
   and longitude coordinates are added to the Contact information for the
   repository. For more information on how to edit your :term:`repository`
   record, see: :ref:`edit-archival-institution`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   For **all** latitude and longitude :term:`fields <field>` in AtoM, you need
   to use the Signed degrees format (e.g. DDD.dddd) for the data to work!
   Degree/minute/second (DMS) and cardinal based formats (e.g. DDD MM SS +
   compass direction) **will not work** and the map will not be generated
   properly.

   When only one field is provided, latitude values should be entered first,
   followed by a comma before the longitude values.

   Here is an example of the latitude and longitude for Vancouver, BC, Canada:

   **Correct format:** (signed degrees)

   * 49.246292, -123.116226

   **Will not work in AtoM:** (DMS cardinal)

   * 49Â° 14' 46.6512" N, 123Â° 6' 58.4136" W

5. When the :term:`archival institution` record is saved with the latitude
   and longitude coordinates added to the Contact area, the map will appear at
   the top of the :term:`view page`.

.. TIP::

   There is also a command-line tool that can be run by a system administrator
   that will use repository contact information and address data to
   automatically populate all latitude and longitude fields. This can be
   really useful in a :term:`multi-repository system` when you want to enable
   this maps feature, but don't want to manually find and add all of the
   latitude and longitude coordinates. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`repository-lat-long`

===========================================================

When viewing an :term:`archival institution` in AtoM, an "Upload limit" bar
is displayed in the :ref:`context menu <recurring-context-menu>` on the the
left-hand side of the institution's page.

.. NOTE::

   By default, only authenticated (i.e. logged in) users can *view* the
   "Upload limit" bar, and only an authenticated :term:`administrator` can
   *edit* the upload limit. For more information on edit privileges and user
   roles see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. For information on logging in,
   see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.

   Note that an administrator can also disable the display of this widget, 
   which can sometimes be useful for improving page load performance. See above:

   * :ref:`repository-upload-setting`

   Additionally, note that a system administrator can configure a global 
   upload limit - see:

   * :ref:`total-upload-space`

**To set the digital object upload limit for an archival institution:**

1. Navigate to the :term:`archival institution` you wish to edit. You can do
   this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the archival
   institution - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.
2. Click the "Edit" link located below the "Upload limit" bar on the left-hand
   side of the page.

3. A dialogue box will appear that will allow for 1 of 3 options:

   * **Disable uploads** will prevent users from uploading any
     :term:`digital objects <digital object>`.
   * **Limit uploads to _____ GB** will allow an administrator to set a specific
     upload limit per :term:`archival institution`.
   * **Allow unlimited uploads** is the default setting in AtoM that places no
     restrictions on an authenticated user's digital object uploads.

4. You can quit the process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button, or the
   exiting (i.e. clicking "X") the window. Any changes made will not be saved.
5. When you've made your selection, click the "Save" button. The :term:`archival
   institution's <archival institution>` :term:`view page` will display your
   changes made according to :

   * If you selected **Disable uploads**, the Upload limit bar will
     automatically be removed and the Upload limit section will indicate that
     the uploads have been disabled.
   * If you selected **Allow unlimited uploads**, the Upload limit bar will
     automatically be removed and the Upload limit section will indicate the
     institution's current uploaded amount, as well as the limit, which will be
     *Unlimited* (e.g. "2.65 GB of *Unlimited*").
   * If you selected a specific number of GB as an upload limit, that number
     will appear below the Upload limit bar, alongside the institution's current
     uploaded amount (e.g. "2.56 of 10 GB").

6. Additional changes to the Upload limit can be made at any time by following
   the steps 2 through 5.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The limits set here are different than the execution limits set by your
   system administrator. For more information, see: :ref:`Execution limits
   <installation-execution-limits>`.

   descriptions <archival description>` but does not remove the archival
   descriptions themselves.
