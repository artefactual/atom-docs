Authority records
=================

Authority records are one of the core :doc:`entity types
<../overview/entity-types>` in AtoM and provide users with a means to control
the representation of information about actors - :term:`corporate bodies
<corporate body>`, persons, or families - who interact with archival
materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. Typically, authority
records contain information about the authorized form of name and other forms
of name by which the actor is known, dates of existence, relevant adminstrtive
or biographical history details, and other contextual information;
additionally, roles in :term:`events <event>` and relationships with archival
materials are also captured and expressed.

The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) defines
an authority record as "*The authorized form of name combined with other
information elements that identify and describe the named entity and may also
point to other related authority records.*" Maintaining contextual
information about records :term:`creators <creator>` and other actors is
essential to archival practice, and helps establish the provenance and
authenticity of the related records. Additionally, archival authority records,
like library authority records, can be used to control the creation and use of
:term:`access points <access point>`, thereby improving access for
:term:`researchers <researcher>` and other members of the public. By
maintaining authority records separately from :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`, complex relationships of creation and contribution
can be expressed, even between materials held by different :term:`archival
institutions <archival institution>` or in different kinds of
:term:`repositories <repository>` such as libraries and museums. By using a
recognized international standard to control the creation of authority
records, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` have the
opportunity to share authority records. As the `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__
notes,

      "*Such standardization is of particular international benefit when the
      sharing or linking of contextual information is likely to cross national
      boundaries. The multinational character of past and present record
      keeping creates the incentive for international standardization which
      will support the exchange of contextual information. For example,
      processes such as colonialization, immigration and trade have
      contributed to the multinational character of recordkeeping.*" (ISAAR
      Introduction)

In AtoM, the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to describe
authority records are based on the `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__
*International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies,
Persons and Families* (`ISAAR <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf-
international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-
and-families-2nd-edition.html>`__).

.. _create-authority-record:

Create a new authority record
=============================

The `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__ model of authority record use and
maintenance means that separate records are created for all actors (persons,
families, and :term:`corporate bodies <corporate body>`), which can then be
linked to related :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. In AtoM
this process has been automated wherever possible to simplify the workflow -
consequently, a new :term:`authority record` is automatically created any time
a new name (such as a :term:`creator` name or a name :term:`access point`) is
associated with a description. This means that there are several different
ways to create new authority records:

* :ref:`From the main menu <add-authority-main>`
* :ref:`From a related archival description <add-authority-description>`
* :ref:`From an authority record view page <add-authority-view-page>`

.. NOTE::

   To create new authority records, you must be logged in to AtoM with a
   :term:`user account` with sufficient edit permissions to create authority
   records, such as an :term:`administrator`, :term:`editor`, or
   :term:`contributor`. For more information on types of users and edit
   permissions, see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`

.. _add-authority-main:

Add a new authority record from the main menu
---------------------------------------------

.. |plus| image:: images/plus-sign.png
   :height: 18
   :width: 18

1. In the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`, click the
   |plus|:ref:`"Add" <main-menu-add>` and select "Authority record".
   Alternatively, navigate to an authority record view page and click the
   :term:`"Add new" button <add new button>` in the :term:`button block`. AtoM
   takes you to a blank edit page for data entry.
2. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   :term:`information area` to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under
   it.
3. Enter data as required. The authority record edit template is based on the
   `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__ *International Standard Archival Authority
   Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (`ISAAR
   <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf- international-standard-
   archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons- and-families-2nd-
   edition.html>`__). For more information on the use of particular fields in
   the ISAAR authority record edit template, see: :ref:`ISAAR(CPF)
   <isaar-template>`.
4. You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel"
   button in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be
   saved, and no new record will be created. Note that simply navigating away
   from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
   also result in no new record being created.
5. To save the new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <create button>`
   located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

Once the new :term:`authority record` is saved, you will be redirected to the
record's :term:`view page`, where you can review your work. Clicking "Edit"
in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record will re-open the
authority record in :term:`edit mode`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Currently, there is no "Draft" publication status for an :term:`authority
   record` in AtoM. This means that as soon as you create an authority record,
   it will be visible to public users (i.e. unauthenticated users who are not
   logged in). Unauthenticated users will not have access to the
   :term:`button block`, and cannot edit the record.

.. _add-authority-description:

Add a new authority record from a related archival description
--------------------------------------------------------------

In AtoM, whenever a new name is added to an archival description (generally,
either as a :term:`creator` or as a subject by adding a name :term:`access
point`), an authority record is automatically created for the new name. AtoM
:term:`creator` names and name :term:`access points  <access point>` are added
via a :term:`value list` that appears in a :term:`drop-down menu` - as you type
data into the :term:`field`, the value list will narrow its options to present
related suggestions. If an authority record already exists, you can select the
name from the values and a link will be created. If no authority record
already exists, however, new names can be added "on the fly" in these fields:

* :ref:`Creator names <authority-record-creator-names>`
* :ref:`Name access points <authority-record-name-access>`

.. TIP::

   When you are finished creating or editing your :term:`archival
   description`, the new names will appear in the archival description as
   hyperlinks to the new :term:`authority records <authority record>`. The
   authority records generated this way ("on the fly") are merely stub records
   or placeholders - after reviewing your archival description, you should
   follow the hyperlink to the authority record, where you can edit it to
   supplement the contents, such as indicating if it is a person, family, or
   :term:`corporate body`, and adding dates of existence, history, etc. For
   more information on working with the ISAAR-CPF Authority record template
   :term:`fields <field>`, see: :ref:`ISAAR-CPF <isaar-template>`. For more
   information on editing an authority record, see below, :ref:`Edit an
   existing authority record <edit-authority-record>`.


.. _authority-record-creator-names:

Adding Creator names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever a new :term:`creator` name is added to an archival description, a
new :term:`authority record` for that name will be generated when the
:term:`archival description` is saved. Because each edit template uses
different labels for the field to add a new creator, template specific
instructions have been included below.

**ISAD(G) edit template**

* In the "Context :term:`area <information area>`" of the :ref:`ISAD(G)
  template <isad-template>`, enter a new name in the :term:`field` named "Name
  of creator(s)."
* The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record` when you save the
  :term:`archival description`.

**Rules for Archival Description (RAD) edit template**

* In the "Dates of creation" :term:`information area` of the :ref:`RAD
  template <rad-template>`, click the "Add new" button that appears under the
  heading, "Add new name and/or date(s)."
* A dialog will appear with several fields, including "Actor name," "Event
  type," "Date," etc.
* Enter a new name in the "Actor name" field of the pop-up dialog, and then
  click "Submit". The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record`
  when you save the :term:`archival description`.

**Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) edit template**

* In the "Identity elements" :term:`information area` of the :ref:`DACS
  template <dacs-template>`, navigate to the "Name of creator(s)" section, and
  enter a new name. The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record`
  when you save the :term:`archival description`.

**Dublin Core Version 1.1 (DC) edit template**

* In the :ref:`Dublin Core template <dc-template>`, there is only one main
  :term:`information area`, in which a section called "Name(s)" appears, close
  to the top of the record's :term:`edit page`.
* Navigate to the "Name(s)" section, and under the :term:`field` labelled
  "Actor name," enter a new  name.
* The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record` when you save the
  :term:`archival description`.

**Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) edit template**

* In the :ref:`MODS template <mods-template>`, there is only one main
  :term:`information area`, in which a section called "Names and origin info"
  appears, close to the top of the record's :term:`edit page`.
* Navigate to the "Names" and origin info section, and click the "Add new"
  button that appears under the heading, "Add new name and/or date(s)."
* Enter a new name in the "Actor name" field of the pop-up dialog, and then
  click "Submit". The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record`
  when you save the :term:`archival description`.

.. _authority-record-name-access:

Adding Name access points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`ISAD(G) <isad-template>`, :ref:`RAD <rad-template>`, and :ref:`DACS
<dacs-template>` content standards support the inclusion of name
:term:`accesss points <access point>` in :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`; consequently, an "Access points" :term:`information
area` with a :term:`field` for name :term:`access points <access point>` has
been included on these templates.

This field can be used to create an :term:`authority record` for a person,
family, or :term:`corporate body` who is the subject of an archival
description, but not its :term:`creator`. Type a new name into a Name
:term:`access point` :term:`field`. When you save the :term:`archival
description` record, AtoM creates a new :term:`authority record` for the
name.

.. _add-authority-view-page:

Add a new authority record from an authority record view page
-------------------------------------------------------------

A new :term:`authority record` can also be added to AtoM from the :term:`view
page` of any other authority record via the "Add new" button in the
:term:`button block`. To do so:

1. Navigate to an existing :term:`authority record` in AtoM. You can do this
   by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or by
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for  a specific
   :term:`authority record` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for
   more information on navigation in AtoM.
2. At the bottom of the authority record's :term:`view page`, you will see the
   :term:`button block` with several options (Edit, Delete, and Add new).
   Click "Add new".
3. Enter data as required. The authority record edit template is based on the
   `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__ *International Standard Archival Authority
   Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (`ISAAR
   <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf- international-standard-
   archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons- and-families-2nd-
   edition.html>`__). For more information on the use of particular fields in
   the ISAAR authority record edit template, see: :ref:`ISAAR(CPF)
   <isaar-template>`.
4. You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel"
   button in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be
   saved, and no new record will be created. Note that simply navigating away
   from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
   also result in no new record being created.
5. To save the new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <create button>`
   located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

Once the new :term:`authority record` is saved, you will be redirected to the
record's :term:`view page`, where you can review your work. Clicking "Edit"
in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record will re-open the
authority record in :term:`edit mode`.


:ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`

.. _edit-authority-record:

Edit an existing authority record
=================================

1. First, navigate to the :term:`authority record` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the :term:`archival
   description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM. See :ref:`ISAAR-CPF <isaar-template>`
   for more information on specific fields in the authority record edit
   template.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   information area to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under it
4. Add and/or revise data as required.
5. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the
   authority record.
6. To save your edits, click the "Save" button located in the :term:`button
   block` at the bottom of the record.

You will be redirected to the :term:`view page` for the edited
:term:`authority record`, where you can review your work.

:ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`

.. _link-authority-to-description:

Link an existing authority record to an archival description
============================================================

Links between existing authority records and existing archival descriptions
can be added at any time by an authenticated (i.e. logged in) user with
sufficient edit permissions. For more information on types of users and edit
permissions, see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. There are two main ways to
create a link between an authority record and an archival description:

* :ref:`From the archival description <authority-link-from-description>`
* :ref:`From the authority record <authority-link-from-authority>`

.. _authority-link-from-description:

From the archival description
-----------------------------

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival description` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the :term:`archival
   description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. To create a link to an authority record for a creator, follow the steps
   above for :ref:`adding a new creator <authority-record-creator-names>` -
   however, instead of entering a new name, begin typing the name of the
   authority record to which you would like to create a link. The name
   :term:`field` is an auto-complete - as you type, matching results will
   load in a :term:`drop-down menu` below the field. When you see the
   authority record you would like to link, click on it to select it.

.. IMPORTANT::

   This method makes use of  an `auto-complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
   /Auto-complete>`__ field to find the related :term:`authority record` as
   you begin to type its name/title. **Be sure** to pick the record from the
   :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` when it appears - if you type the full
   name and press enter, a new :term:`authority record` will be generated
   instead of a link being created to an existing one!

4. To create links to multiple authority records, you can repeat this process
   as needed. When you are done editing the record, save the :term:`archival
   description` by scrolling down and pressing "Save" in the :term:`button
   block`.
5. The :term:`archival description` will reload in :term:`view mode`. You
   should be able to see the creator name as a hyperlink on the archival
   description. Follow the link to ensure you have linked to the proper
   :term:`authority record`. The linked archival description will also appear
   in the "Relationships" :term:`information area` of the :term:`authority
   record`.


.. _authority-link-from-authority:

From the authority record
-------------------------

1. First, navigate to the :term:`authority record` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the
   :term:`authority record` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for
   more information on navigation in AtoM.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. In the "Relationships" :term:`information area` of the authority record's
   :term:`edit page`, click the "Add new" button under "Related resources".
4. AtoM will open a pop-up dialog where you can select the related
   :term:`archival description` and define the nature and time frame of the
   relationship.
5. The first :term:`field` in the pop-up dialog, "Title of the related
   resource," is an `auto-complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Auto-
   complete>`__ field: as you type, matching results will load in a 
   :term:`drop-down menu` below the field. When you see the
   :term:`archival description` you would like to link, click on it to select
   it.
6. Add additional details in the subsequent fields to qualify the
   relationship: the "Nature of relationship" field is a :term:`drop-down
   menu` whose values are pulled from the Event types :term:`taxonomy` (see
   :doc:`Terms <../add-edit-content/terms>` for more information on working
   with taxonomies); start, end, and display dates can be added as well. When
   you are finished, click "Submit".
7. The related :term:`archival description` will now appear in the Related
   resources table of the Relationships area. Click the pencil icon to re-open
   the pop-up dialog and edit the relationship, or click the **X** icon to
   remove the relationship link. You can also repeat this process to add
   multiple links by clicking the "Add new" button below the Related
   resources again - AtoM will open a new pop-up dialog. Repeat steps 3-7 as
   needed.
8. When you are finished, click "Save" in the :term:`button block` at the bottom
   of the authority record's :term:`edit page` to save your changes and exit
   :term:`edit mode`.
9. AtoM will reload the :term:`authority record` in :term:`view mode`.
   :ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`. The relationship link will appear
   in the :term:`context menu` on the left-hand side of the page. You can
   click on the related description's title to navigate to the related
   :term:`archival description`.

:ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`

.. _link-two-authority-records:

Create a relationship between two authority records
===================================================

1. First, navigate to the :term:`authority record` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the
   :term:`authority record` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for
   more information on navigation in AtoM.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. In the "Relationships" :term:`information area` of the authority record's
   :term:`edit page`, click the "Add new" button under "Related  corporate
   bodies, persons, or families".
4. AtoM will open a pop-up dialog where you can select the related
   :term:`authority record` and define the nature and time frame of the
   relationship.
5. The first :term:`field` in the pop-up dialog, "Title of the related
   resource," is an `auto-complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Auto-
   complete>`__ field: as you type, matching results will load in a 
   :term:`drop-down menu` below the field. When you see the
   :term:`authority record` you would like to link, click on it to select
   it.

.. NOTE::

   You cannot create a new authority record from this dialog by entering a
   new name. If the second authority record does not exist yet, follow the
   steps above to :ref:`create a new authority record <create-authority-record>`
   and then follow these steps from the new record to create the
   relationship.

6. Add additional details in the subsequent fields to qualify the
   relationship. When you are finished, click "Submit".
7. The related :term:`authority record` will now appear in the *Related
   corporate bodies, persons, or families* table of the Relationships area.
   Click the pencil icon to re-open the pop-up dialog and edit the
   relationship, or click the **X** icon to remove the relationship link. You
   can also repeat this process to add multiple links by clicking the "Add
   new" button below the *Related corporate bodies, persons, or families*
   again - AtoM will open a new pop-up dialog. Repeat steps 3-6 as needed.
8. When you are finished, click "Save" in the :term:`button block` at the bottom
   of the authority record's :term:`edit page` to save your changes and exit
   :term:`edit mode`.

   :ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`. The relationship is expressed in
   the "Relationships" :term:`information area` of the authority record's
   :term:`view page`, and the related record's name will appear as a
   hyperlink.

:ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`

.. _link-authority-record-function:

Create a relationship between an authority record and a function
================================================================

AtoM can also create a linked relationship between a :term:`function` and an
:term:`authority record`. A function is a type of entity that describes
activities linked to records creation, maintenance and use. For more
information on working with Functions in AtoM, see: :doc:`Functions
<../add-edit-content/functions>`. Below are the steps to create a
relationship between an existing authority record and an existing function:

1. Navigate to the :term:`function` you would like to relate to an
   :term:`authority record`. You can do this by going to the Browse page for
   functions (**Browse > Functions**) and then either browsing through the
   list, or using the dedicated Functions search bar on the Browse functions
   page to find the related function. Click on the related function to
   navigate to its :term:`view page`. For more information on browsing and
   searching in AtoM, see: :doc:`Browse <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`Search <../access-content/search-atom>`.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. In the "Relationships" :term:`information area` of the function's
   :term:`edit page`, click the "Add new" button under "Related  authority
   records".
4. AtoM will open a pop-up dialog where you can select the related
   :term:`authority record` and define the nature and time frame of the
   relationship.
5. The first :term:`field` in the pop-up dialog, "Title of the related
   resource," is an `auto-complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Auto-
   complete>`__ field: as you type, matching results will load in a 
   :term:`drop-down menu` below the field. When you see the
   :term:`authority record` you would like to link, click on it to select
   it.

.. NOTE::

   You cannot create a new authority record from this dialog by entering a
   new name. If the related authority record does not exist yet, follow the
   steps above to :ref:`create a new authority record
   <create-authority-record>` and then follow these steps from the beginning
   to create the relationship.

6. Add additional details in the subsequent fields to qualify the
   relationship. When you are finished, click "Submit".
7. The related :term:`authority record` will now appear in the *Related
   authority records* table of the Relationships area. Click the pencil icon
   to re-open the pop-up dialog and edit the relationship, or click the **X**
   icon to remove the relationship link. You can also repeat this process to
   add multiple links by clicking the "Add new" button below the *Related
   authority records* again - AtoM will open a new pop-up dialog. Repeat steps
   3-6 as needed.
8. When you are finished, click "Save" in the :term:`button block` at the
   bottom of the function's :term:`edit page` to save your changes and exit
   :term:`edit mode`.
9. AtoM will reload the :term:`function` in :term:`view mode`.
   :ref:`Back to top <authority-records>`. The relationship is expressed in
   the "Relationships" :term:`information area` of the function's
   :term:`view page`, and the related record's name will appear as a
   hyperlink. If you follow the hyperlink, you will see that the related
   function now appears in the "Relationships" area of the linked authority
   record.

.. _delete-authority-record:

Delete an authority record
==========================

1. Navigate to the :term:`authority record` you wish to edit. You can do this
   by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or :doc:`searching
   <../access-content/search-atom>` for the :term:`authority record` - see
   :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more information on navigation
   in AtoM.
2. Click the :term:`Delete button` in the :term:`button block`.
3. AtoM prompts you to confirm the delete request: click "Delete" to proceed
   (or you can click "Cancel" to return to the authority record's
   :term:`view page`).
4. AtoM deletes the record and opens the :term:`authority record` browse
   results page.

.. IMPORTANT::

   **Consequences of deleting an authority record:**

   * AtoM uses authority records as the basis for its :term:`archival
     institution` :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` template - that is, an
     archival institution record is a special kind of authority record. IF the
     authority record being deleted is also registered as an :term:`archival
     institution`, the archival institution record is ALSO deleted.
   * Any creation :term:`events <event>` linked to the :term:`authority
     record` are disassociated from the related :term:`archival description`,
     but the :term:`archival description` itself is NOT deleted.
   * Similarly, if a :term:`function` is linked to an :term:`authority record`
     and the authority record is deleted, the relationship is disassociated,
     but the related :term:`function` is NOT deleted.
