Deaccession records
===================

The :term:`accession record` is the means by which the accessioning process is
documented - an accession record is an administrative and descriptive document
that summarizes standard information about the process of transferring
materials to a repository, including information about the provenance,
contents and legal and physical transfer of the records such as, rights and
restrictions. It often precedes arrangement and description, and can be used
as the basis for the creation of an :term:`archival description` once the
materials have been arranged.

Sometimes archival materials are deaccessioned by an institution - the
materials are removed from the collection for destruction or transfer of
custody. To maintain a complete record, many archivists will create a
:term:`deaccession record` and associate it with the original :term:`accession
record`, rather than simply destroying all records associated with the former
holdings. For long-term accountability and provenance, this is recommended
practice.

In AtoM, a :term:`deaccession record` can be added to an existing
:term:`accession record`. The deacession record comprises several basic
fields to capture information about the materials being deaccession and the
reasons behind the deaccssion. Fields include:

* Deaccession number
* Scope (whole accession, or only part)
* Date (of deaccession)
* Description (of materials being deaccessioned)
* Extent (number of units and the measurement of the records to be
  deaccessioned)
* Reason

.. NOTE::

   To create and manage deaccession records, you must be logged in to AtoM
   with a :term:`user account` with sufficient edit permissions, such as an
   :term:`administrator`, :term:`editor`, or :term:`contributor`. For more
   information on types of users and edit permissions, see
   :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. For help logging into AtoM, see:
   :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.


.. _add-deaccession-record:

Add a new deaccession record
============================

Deaccession records are not created independently from :term:`accession
records <accession record>` in AtoM - instead, they are appended to existing
accession records. To add a new deaccession record to an existing accession
record:

1. Navigate to the :term:`accession record` you want to deaccession. You can
   do this via the :term:`main menu` in the AtoM :term:`header bar`, by
   clicking on **Manage > Accessions**. For more information on navigation in
   AtoM, see: :ref:`Access content <access-content>`.

2. Click on the "Deaccession" button located in the :term:`button block` at
   the bottom of the accession record's :term:`view page`.

3. AtoM takes you to the empty deaccession edit template, open and ready for
   data entry. Note that the Deaccession number will be added to the original
   Accession record ID (shown at the top of the :term:`edit page`).

4. Add data as required. The *Scope* area is a :term:`drop-down menu`: "Whole"
   or "Part," so you can deaccession all or some of the records in the
   original accession.

5. You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel"
   button in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be
   saved, and no new record will be created. Note that simply navigating away
   from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
   also result in no new record being created.
6. To save the new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <create button>`
   located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

7. AtoM takes you to the view accession record screen. At the bottom of the
   :term:`accession record`, there is a new "Deaccession" :term:`information
   area`. The :term:`deaccession record` has been added as a hyperlink to the
   accession record.
