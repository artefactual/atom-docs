The :term:`Clipboard` is a :term:`user interface` element that allows users to
select records while searching and browsing, and add them to a list (the
"clipboard"), for later review or further action. All users can also perform
exports of Clipboard results via the user interface - for more information, see:

* :ref:`xml-export-clipboard`
* :ref:`csv-export-clipboard`

Currently the Clipboard is only available for use with
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
:term:`authority records <authority record>`, and
:term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`. Clipboard pin icons are
also available on the Inventory list page, and the Description updates page. For
more information, see:

* :ref:`browse-hierarchy-inventory`
* :ref:`search-updates`

The clipboard is  **session-based**, meaning that adding results to the
clipboard and then logging in/out (which starts a new session) or closing your
browser without first saving the clipboard results will result in all pinned
items being lost. However, users can now save clipboards and reload the
clipboard results in a future session if desired. An :term:`administrator` can
also determine how long saved clipboards are stored in the database before being 
purged, via a setting found in |gears| **Admin > Settings > Global** - see: 
:ref:`clipboard-save-setting`. 

.. IMPORTANT::

   The session is renewed when logging in or out of the application - so unless
   you save your clipboard, you might lose your results if you log in or log
   out!

.. _clipboard-menu:

Clipboard menu
==============

The Clipboard has its own menu icon in the AtoM :term:`header bar`, visible to
all users. It is represented by the |clip| paperclip icon. Clicking on the
Clipboard icon in the header bar will reveal a :term:`drop-down menu` with a
count of the objects currently pinned to the clipboard, as well as options to
either clear all current selections from the clipboard, or to go the
Clipboard's view page:

.. image:: images/clipboard-menu.*
   :align: center
   :width: 40%
   :alt: An image of the Clipboard menu.

When records have been pinned to the the Clipboard, the menu will show a
count of pinned items as you move around the application, for reference:

.. image:: images/clipboard-menu2.*
   :align: center
   :width: 40%
   :alt: An image of the Clipboard menu when items are pinned.

The count is also shown in the :term:`drop-down menu`, where it will identify
the different :term:`entity` types:

.. image:: images/clipboard-menu3.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: An image of the Clipboard menu when items are pinned.

The menu has four options. The "Clear selections" option will remove all items
(across all entity types) currently pinned to the clipboard. On the clipboard
page, they won't be cleared until you refresh the browser, giving you an
opportunity to re-pin them if you've removed them by accident - however,
anywhere else in the application, this **removal will be immediate**. The "Go
to clipboard" option in the menu will take you to the Clipboard page, described
in more detail below: :ref:`clipboard-page`. The "Save clipboard" option will
allow you to save your selections and return to them at a future session, and
the "Load clipboard" option will load a previously saved selection. For more
information on these options, see below:

* :ref:`save-clipboard`
* :ref:`load-saved-clipboard`

.. _clipboard-pinning:

Pinning records to the clipboard
================================

Users can add or "pin" an :term:`archival description`, an 
:term:`authority record`, and/or an :term:`archival institution` record to the 
clipboard for review or further action from 2 places:

* Any search or browse result page where the desired record appears
* Any :term:`view page` of a record that is a supported entity on the
  clipboard (e.g. the view pages for archival descriptions, authority records,
  and repository records)

You can add as many results as you want to the clipboard at a time - the
Clipboard will paginate if there are more than the global setting for
:ref:`results per page <results-page>`.

When they are not selected, the clip icons are represented in light grey. When
a user hovers over one, its background will turn grey, and a tooltip will
appear. When a result has been selected and pinned to the clipboard by
clicking on the clip icon, it will appear blue to indicate that the item is
now pinned.

**Search / browse pages**

On the :term:`archival description` results stubs that appear in search and
browse pages, a "paper clip" icon (similar to the one used in the
:term:`clipboard menu`) appears in the upper-right corner of the results stub.
Click on this icon to add the result to the Clipboard.

.. image:: images/pin-results.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of archival description results being pinned to the clipboard

If you are using the "card view", such as when browsing digital objects, the
clipboard link appears on the bottom right of the card:

.. image:: images/pin-results-card.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of archival description results being pinned to the clipboard

For :term:`archival institution` records, there are also two views - the card
view and the table view. See :ref:`browse-institutions` for more information.
On the table view, the clipboard link appears on the right side of the table:

.. image:: images/pin-repos-table.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of repository results being pinned to the clipboard

If you are using the "card view", the clipboard link appears on the bottom
right of the card:

.. image:: images/pin-repos-card.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of repository results being pinned to the clipboard

On :term:`authority record` search and browse pages, the clipboard links
appear on the right side of the results stubs:

.. image:: images/browse-people-orgs.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the browse authority records page with clipboard links
         visible

**View pages**

On the :term:`view page` for an :term:`archival description`,
:term:`authority record`, or :term:`archival institution` record, the option to
pin the current record to the clipboard is found in the right-hand
:term:`context menu`, under a "Clipboard" heading. When the item has not yet
been pinned to the clipboard, the :ref:`text link <recurring-text-links>` in
the sidebar will read "Add". Click the link to add the current description to
the clipboard. Once selected, the link, now outlined in blue to indicate the
item is pinned, will read "Remove" - click the link again to remove the item
from the clipboard.

.. image:: images/pin-viewpage.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%

.. _clipboard-page:

Using the clipboard page
========================

When you've selected the records that you want, you can navigate to the
Clipboard using the "Go to clipboard" link in the :ref:`clipboard-menu`, found
in the AtoM :term:`header bar` at the top of the page.

On load, you'll see results stubs for the descriptions you've pinned. If there
are more than 10 results, a pager will appear.

.. TIP::

   10 results per page is the default global setting in AtoM, but an
   :term:`administrator` can change this value via |gears| **Admin >
   Settings**. For more information, see: :ref:`results-page`.

The Clipboard page will only display one :term:`entity` type at a time - by
default when first arriving on the page, :term:`archival description` results
will be displayed. You can switch to view other entity types using the Entity
type :term:`drop-down menu` at the top of the results:

.. image:: images/clipboard-switch-entity.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the entity type drop-down menu on the clipboard page

When a new entity is selected, AtoM will reload the page and display the
clipped items for that entity. For example, here is the view page for
authority records pinned to the clipboard:

.. image:: images/clipboard-actors.*
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the entity type drop-down menu on the clipboard page

A count of the results attached to the clipboard for the current entity will
appear at the top of the page (**tip:** remember you can always see the
global count, and a breakdown of each entity, in the :term:`clipboard menu`
drop-down). Below this, and above the Clipboard results, are several action
links - A print preview button on the far left, A :ref:`recurring-sort-button`
on the far right, and the Entity type drop-down menu.

.. image:: images/clipboard-2.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the clipboard, with the link options highlighted

At the bottom of the page, in the :term:`button block` there is an option to
clear results. This button behaves differently than the option in the |clip|
:term:`clipboard menu` - it will **only** clear results for the current entity
(e.g. archival description, authority record, or repository record), leaving
other entity records pinned to the clipboard.

Authenticated (i.e. logged in) users will also see an Export button in the
button block - for more information on exporting from the clipboard, see:
:ref:`csv-export-clipboard`.

Print preview
-------------

Clicking this option will display a printer-optimized version of the page,
with all buttons removed. Note that you will still need to use your browser's
built-in print options for actual printing.

.. image:: images/clipboard-print.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of a Clipboard print preview

Sort button
-----------

These buttons will allow you to sort your pinned results a number of different
ways. For more information, see: :ref:`recurring-sort-button`.

Export CSV
----------

Authenticated users (e.g. those logged in) can generate a CSV export of their
clipboard results. When ready, the CSV is made available on the
:ref:`Jobs <manage-jobs>` page. For more information, see:
:ref:`csv-export-clipboard`.

Pinning and unpinning results on the clipboard
----------------------------------------------

Elsewhere in AtoM, when you unpin a result you have previously pinned to the
Clipboard, it will be immediately removed. However, on the Clipboard page, an
extra step is included, to allow you to better review your changes to the
Clipboard results. When a result is unpinned, AtoM will provide you with a
warning at the top of the page, but the result will stay visible until the
page reloads, in case you removed it by accident:

.. image:: images/clipboard-warning.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the clipboard, with a removal warning at the top

The warning reads:

*Note: clipboard items unclipped in this page will be removed from the
clipboard when the page is refreshed. You can re-select them now, or reload
the page to remove them completely. Using the sort or print preview buttons
will also cause a page reload - so anything currently deselected will be lost!*

You can re-add results at this point, by clicking on the paperclip icon next
to the result again if desired. If you use any of the options on the page
(Print preview, Export, or change the sort order with the sort button),
the page will reload - so your unpinned results will be lost. If you manually
refresh your browser, this will also cause results unpinned on the Clipboard
page to be permanently removed. To re-add lost results after a reload, you
will have to return to either the relevant record's :term:`view page`, or
find it again via :ref:`search-atom` or :ref:`browse` and re-add it to the
clipboard.

To remove all results at once, you can either use the "Clear selections"
option found in the |clip| Clipboard menu in the AtoM :term:`header bar` (see
above, :ref:`clipboard-menu`), or you can use the "Clear" button found in
the :term:`button block` located at the bottom of the Clipboard page.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Remember, the Clear option in the |clip| Clipboard menu will remove **all**
   results from all entity types at once, without warning. The Clear button on
   the bottom of the Clipboard page will only remove the current :term:`entity`
   type - so if you clear archival descriptions, your authority records and
   institution records will still be pinned.

.. image:: images/button-block-clipboard.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the button block found on the Clipboard page

You will still be provided with the warning when using these options on the
Clipboard page - but be aware: using the "Clear selections" option in the
Clipboard menu when elsewhere in the application will **immediately** remove
all results!

.. _clipboard-export-all:

Using the clipboard to export records
=====================================

The clipboard has been configured so that all users, whether anonymous (i.e.
public) or authenticated (i.e. logged in), can export records, in both CSV and
XML formats, depending on the formats supported in AtoM for export.

Documentation on how to export records using the clipboard is maintained in the
general :ref:`import-export` documentation. For more information, see:

* :ref:`xml-export-clipboard`
* :ref:`csv-export-clipboard`

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`clipboard`

:ref:`Back to top <clipboard>`

.. _save-clipboard:

Saving your clipboard for another session
=========================================

With the release of 2.5, all users are now able to save a clipboard, close the
browser, and return at a later time to continue to use the saved entries. On
save, AtoM will generate a unique ID number that will be used to load the
clipboard in the future. This means a saved clipboard could potentially be
used to support reference requests - for example, a researcher identifies
records of interest, adds them to the clipboard and saves, and then sends the
saved clipboard ID to the reference archivist. The archivist is then able to
load the saved clipboard and see the records of interest for retrieval, which
can be made available when a researcher visit is scheduled.

.. IMPORTANT::

   To avoid having AtoM's database grow indefinitely when the clipboard is
   used heavily, saved clipboards are not stored indefinitely. Instead, an
   :term:`administrator` can configure how many days saved clipboards are
   stored before being purged from the database, via a setting in |gears|
   **Admin > Settings > Global**. See:

   * :ref:`clipboard-save-setting`

   By default in new installations, **this setting is set to 0 days** - make
   sure you configure this setting before using the "Save clipboard" option,
   to ensure that saved results are not lost!

   Note that AtoM also has a command-line task that can be used by a system 
   administrator to manage and delete saved clipboards. For more information, 
   see:

   * :ref:`tools-expire`

**To save and reload Clipboard results:**

When you are ready to leave your current session, click on the 
:term:`clipboard menu` button and choose "Save clipboard". 

.. image:: images/save-clipboard.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: An image of a Clipboard menu

Alternatively, you can also click the "Save" button in the :term:`button block` 
at the bottom of the Clipboard page.

.. image:: images/button-block-clipboard.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the button block found on the Clipboard page

When saved, AtoM will load the Clipboard :term:`view page` and generate a 
message with an ID number of your saved session and prompt you to record the 
number for later.

.. image:: images/save-clipboard-number.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: A saved Clipboard message

.. IMPORTANT:: 

   Be sure to save this number for future reference! You won't be able to 
   reload your clipboard without it. 

Once you've recorded the saved clipboard's ID, you can now exit your browser. 
See :ref:`below <load-saved-clipboard>` for instructions on how to load your
clipboard during a future session.

.. _load-saved-clipboard:

Loading a saved clipboard
=========================

When reloading a saved clipboard, users have the option to either
overwrite/replace any records currently pinned to the clipboard with the saved
records, or merge the two clipboard result sets together. This merge option
can allow for asynchronous collaboration between two AtoM users - for example,
two different researchers coordinating to pin records of interest in different
sessions and then combining the results, or two different archivists working
on arrangement and description sharing work in progress.

.. IMPORTANT::

   To avoid having AtoM's database grow indefinitely when the clipboard is
   used heavily, saved clipboards are not stored indefinitely. Instead, an
   :term:`administrator` can configure how many days saved clipboards are
   stored before being purged from the database, via a setting in |gears|
   **Admin > Settings > Global**. See:

   * :ref:`clipboard-save-setting`

   By default in new installations, **this setting is set to 0 days** - make
   sure you configure this setting before using the "Save clipboard" option,
   to ensure that saved results are not lost!

   Note that AtoM also has a command-line task that can be used by a system 
   administrator to manage and delete saved clipboards. For more information, 
   see:

   * :ref:`tools-expire`

**To load a saved clipboard in AtoM**:

 When you return and want to see your saved :term:`clipboard`, choose "Load 
 clipboard" from the :term:`clipboard menu` and enter your saved number into 
 the "Clipboard ID" field.

.. image:: images/load-clipboard.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Load a saved Clipboard

The "Action" menu is a :term:`drop-down menu` that contains two options: 

* Merge saved clipboard with existing results
* Replace existing results with saved clipboard

If you currently have 0 results on this session's clipboard, it doesn't matter
which option you choose. However, if you have already pinned records to the 
clipboard during this session, AtoM will let you determine how it will handle
loading the previously saved clipboard results. 

If you would like to purge any records currently added to the clipboard and 
replace them with your previously saved results, choose "Replace existing results 
with saved clipboard." Note that overwrites the current session, meaning that 
any records currently on the clipboard for this session **will be lost** when 
your saved clipboard is loaded. 

If you would like to combine the current pinned records from this session with 
your saved clipboard results, choose "Merge saved clipboard with existing 
results." On load, AtoM will combine the current session results with those from
the saved clipboard. If the same record is found in both sessions, it will appear
only once on the combined results

Once you've configured your preferences, click the "Load" button found in the 
:term:`button block` at the bottom of the Load clipboard page. 

Your previously saved results will load. Note that if you have saved entries
from different entity types, they will all be present, though they may not be 
immediately visible - AtoM shows only one :term:`entity` type at a time, and by 
default will show :term:`archival description` results first.  You can switch 
entity types using the :term:`drop-down menu` found at the top right above the
clipboard results.
