DACS and the ISAD CSV template
==============================

At present, there is no DACS-based CSV template for importing descriptions
into  AtoM. However, because DACS maps so well to the `International Council
on Archives <http://www.ica.org/>`_ ' ISAD(G) standard, the ISAD CSV template
can be used.  The CSV mappings below will provide guidance on which ISAD CSV
fields can be used to  import your DACS-based descriptions into AtoM.

To download the ISAD(G) CSV template for AtoM, please visit our wiki page:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates

Field descriptions
==================

DACS is maintained by the Society of American Archivists 
(`SAA <http://www2.archivists.org>`__), and the version used in AtoM is 
available at:

* https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs/describing-archives-a-content-standard-dacs-second-

Information below includes:

* **Template field** refers to the default label for that field in AtoM
* **CSV Column** refers to the title of the related column in the ((ISAD) CSV
  template
* **DACS Rule** refers to the rule from the applicable standard and/or the
  instructions provided by AtoM.
* **EAD** refers to the field mapping to EAD
* **Notes** includes any other information needed for successful data entry or
  CSV import.

that might be employed as access points may be found in the following areas of 
the descriptive record: 

* Title Element (2.3) 
* Scope and Content Element (3.1) 
* Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)

A variety of general and specialized subject thesauri, including the *Library of

**DACS Rule**: Terms that indicate the documentary form(s) or intellectual
characteristics of the records being described (e.g., minutes, diaries,
reports, watercolors, or documentaries) provide the user with an indication of
the content of the materials based on an understanding of the common
properties of particular document types. For example, one can deduce the
contents of ledgers because they are a standard form of accounting record, one
that typically contains certain types of data. Documentary forms are most
often noted in the following areas of the descriptive record: 

* Title Element (2.3)
* Extent Element (2.5)
* Scope and Content Element (3.1)
 
The *Art & Architecture Thesaurus*, the *Library of Congress Authorities*, or
appropriate media-specific thesauri should be the first sources consulted for
terms denoting documentary forms and literary genres.

Name access points
------------------

**Template Field** Name access points (subjects)

**ISAD CSV Column** ``nameAccessPoints``

**DACS Rule**: The names of persons, families, and organizations that are
associated with a body of archival materials, either as the creator or the
subject of the records, constitute an important pathway by which researchers
discover relevant materials. Names that are rendered as nominal access points
can be found in several areas of the descriptive record:

* Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6) 
* Title Element (2.3) 
* Scope and Content Element (3.1) 
* Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7) 
* Custodial History Element (5.1) 
* Immediate Source of Acquisition Element (5.2)

At a minimum, an access point should be made for every name included in the
Name of Creator(s) Element in a single-level description or at the highest
level in a multilevel description. Names found in other descriptive elements
may be utilized as access points in accordance with local or consortial
practice.

.. NOTE:: 

   The DACS standard also recommends access points related to occupations, as 
   well as functions and activities. In AtoM, this data can be captured on
   other :term:`entity` types, such as :term:`authority records <authority record>`
   (which allow the addition of Occupation access points) and :term:`function` 
   records. For more information, see: 

   * :ref:`authority-records`
   * :ref:`authority-access-points`
   * :ref:`functions`

 The :term:`publication status` refers to the public visibility of a
 description for unauthenticated (e.g. not logged in) users. The default
 terms available are "Published" (i.e. visible to public users), and "Draft"
 (e.g. not visible to public users). See: :ref:`publish-archival-description`.

 In the :ref:`Global Site Settings <global-settings>`, if the default
 publication status is set to draft, all imported descriptions will be set to
 draft and the EAD file will have the value "draft" in the
 <odd type="publicationStatus"> tag.
