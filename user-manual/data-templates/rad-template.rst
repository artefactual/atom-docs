   The data entry fields for the Title and statement of responsibility area.

Title proper
------------

**Template field** Title proper

**CSV Column** ``title``

**RAD Rule** Enter the title proper, either transcribed or supplied (RAD 1.1B)

**EAD**

At a parent level:

.. code-block:: xml

   <archdesc level="[name of level]">
      <did>
         <unittitle encodinganalog="1.1B">


At a child level:

.. code-block:: xml

      <did>
         <unittitle encodinganalog="1.1B">

.. NOTE::

   The EAD tag ``<titleproper encodinganalog="title">`` refers to the
   title of the finding aid, not the archival description.

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

General material designation
----------------------------

**Template field** General material designation

**CSV Column** ``radGeneralMaterialDesignation``

**RAD Rule** Select the General Material Designation at the highest level of

   Although the RAD standard specifies set values for General Material
   Designations, in AtoM these can be edited in the Material type
   :term:`taxonomy` (see: :ref:`Add a new term <add-term>`). As of 2.2, the RAD
   template also has a separate Genre taxonomy, which uses the ``<genreform>``
   EAD element as well, but without the ``@source`` and ``@encodinganalog``
   attributes.

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

Level of description
--------------------

**Template field** Level of description

**CSV Column** ``levelOfDescription``

**RAD Rule** Select a level of description from the drop-down menu. See RAD 1.0A for
rules and conventions on selecting levels of description.

**EAD**


At the parent level:

.. code-block:: xml

   <archdesc level="fonds" relatedencoding="RAD">


At the child level:

.. code-block:: xml

   <dsc type="combined">
      <c level="[name of level]">

.. NOTE::

   An :term:`administrator` can edit the values in the Levels of
   description :term:`taxonomy` (see: :ref:`Add a new term <add-term>`). In
   CSV import, if a term is used that is not already in the taxonomy, it will
   be added to the Levels of description taxonomy.

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

Add new child levels
--------------------

**Template field** Identifier, Level, Title, Date

**CSV Column** See notes below

**RAD Rule** *Identifier*: Enter an unambiguous code used to uniquely identify the
description.

*Level*: Select a level of description from the drop-down menu.
See RAD 1.0A for rules and conventions on selecting levels of description.

*Title*: Enter the title proper, either transcribed or supplied (RAD 1.1B).

*Date*: (Works similarly to the display date field when adding a date of
creation; see :ref:`below <template-dates>` for more information in RAD)

**EAD** N/A (see the related fields elsewhere in this page)

.. NOTE::

   This widget has been added to help improve workflows when creating new
   descriptions via the :term:`user interface`.  When entering descriptions
   manually, users can add new :term:`child records <child record>` in this area
   while creating a parent record.

   The *dates* field corresponds to a date of creation - if you would like a
   different kind of date, you will have to either navigate to the child
   description after saving the new :term:`parent record`, and change the date
   type, or simply ignore the date field in the widget, and add the correct
   date type manually to the child record after saving the new parent record.

   In CSV import, adding child records can be achieved using the *legacyID* and
   *parentID* columns. See :ref:`csv-legacy-id-mapping`.

Repository
----------

**Template field** Repository

**CSV Column** ``repository``

**RAD Rule** Select the :term:`repository` that has custody and
control of the archival material. The values in this field are drawn from the
Authorized form of name field in archival institution records. Search for an
existing name by typing the first few characters of the name. Alternatively,
type a new name to create and link to a new archival institution.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <archdesc>
      <did>
         <repository>
            <corpname>

.. NOTE::

   When an address is included in the related :term:`archival institution` (i.e.
   added to the Contact area of the linked repository record), the address will
   also appear in the EAD at the parent level. Because EAD does not include
   attributes for the ``<addressline>`` element, these will not roundtrip properly
   when exported from one AtoM instance and into another - all the information
   will appear in one field of the Contact area upon re-import. Below is an
   example of the EAD with an address included:

   .. code-block:: xml

    <repository>
        <corpname>Artefactual Archives</corpname>
        <address>
          <addressline>Suite 201 – 301 6th Street</addressline>
          <addressline>New Westminster</addressline>
          <addressline>British Columbia</addressline>
          <addressline>Canada</addressline>
          <addressline>Telephone: (604)527-2056</addressline>
          <addressline>Email: info@artefactual.com</addressline>
          <addressline>http://www.artefactual.com</addressline>
          </address>
    </repository>

.. IMPORTANT::

   When linking an :term:`archival institution` to an :term:`archival description`,
   You should only link at the highest level of description. AtoM will
   automatically inherit the repository name at lower levels. This conforms to
   RAD's General Rule 1.0A2d *Non-repetition of information*: "Do not repeat
   information at a lower level of description that has already been given at a
   higher level...." Linking a repository at all levels of description (instead
   of just at the parent level) in a large hierarchy can also impact performance.

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

Reference code
--------------

**Template field** Identifier

**CSV Column** ``identifier``

**RAD Rule** Enter an unambiguous code used to uniquely identify the description.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unitid encodinganalog="1.8B11" countrycode="[2 letter country code]">

.. NOTE::

   This field displays to non-logged in users as "Reference code."
   While editing the record, the full reference code including any identifiers
   :ref:`inherited <inherit-reference-code>` from higher levels will appear
   below the Identifier field. The ``@countrycode`` value is taken from the
   Country value entered into the Contact area of the related :term:`repository`.


:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

Alternative identifier
----------------------

**Template field** Add alternative identifier(s) [link beneath identifier
field]

**CSV Columns** ``alternativeIdentifiers`` and ``alternativeIdentifierLabels``

**RAD Rule** N/A (see note below)

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unitid type="alternative" label="[user entered value]">

.. NOTE::

   The use of the alternative identifier fields is documented in full here:

   * :ref:`add-alternative-id`

   In the CSV templates, the columns can accept multiple values, separated by a
   pipe ``|`` character. The label values will be matched 1:1 with the
   identifiers.

**Template field** Edition statement

**CSV Column** ``radEdition``

**RAD Rule** "Transcribe the edition statement relating to the item being
described." (RAD 1.2B1) "If the item being described lacks an edition
statement but is known to contain significant changes from other editions,
supply a suitable brief statement in the language and script of the title
proper and enclose it in square brackets." (RAD 1.2B3)

Edition statement of responsibility
-----------------------------------

**Template field** Edition statement of responsibility

**CSV Column** ``radEditionStatementOfResponsibility``

**RAD Rule** "Transcribe a statement of responsibility relating to one or more
editions, but not to all editions, of the item being described following the
edition statement if there is one." (RAD 1.2.C1) "When describing the first
edition, give all statements of responsibility in the Title and statement of

Statement of scale (cartographic)
---------------------------------

**Template field** Statement of scale (cartographic)

**CSV Column** ``radStatementOfScaleCartographic``

**RAD Rule** "Give the scale of the unit being described...as a representative
fraction (RF) expressed as a ratio (1: ). Precede the ratio by Scale. Give the
scale even if it is already recorded as part of the title proper or other
title information." (RAD 5.3B1)

Issuing jurisdiction and denomination (philatelic)
--------------------------------------------------

**Template field** Issuing jurisdiction and denomination (philatelic)

**CSV Column** ``radIssuingJurisdiction``

**RAD Rule** "Give the name of the jurisdiction (e.g., government) responsible for
issuing the philatelic records." (RAD 12.3B1) "For all units possessing a
denomination (e.g., postage stamps, revenue stamps, postal stationery items),
give the denomination in a standardized format, recording the denomination
number in Arabic numerals followed by the name of the currency unit. Include a
denomination statement even if the denomination is already recorded as part of
the title proper or other title information." (RAD 12.3C1)

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

.. _template-authority:

Authority record fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These fields are found in the CSV template but when entering descriptions
manually are found in the :term:`authority record`. However, the description can be
linked to the authority record while entering the data manually.

Creator
-------

**Template field** Creator

**CSV Column** ``eventActors``

**RAD Rule** Use the Actor name field to link an authority record to this
description. Search for an existing name in the authority records by typing
the first few characters of the name. Alternatively, type a new name to
create and link to a new authority record.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <origination encodinganalog="1.4D">
      <name>

.. NOTE::

   This is the default export EAD when an Entity type has not been set for the
   actor on the related :term:`authority record`. The final EAD element can be
   more precise, if the user has entered an Entity type on the related
   :term:`authority record`. When the Entity type is set to **Person**, the EAD
   will export using ``<persname>`` instead of  ``<name>``; when set to
   **Family**, the EAD will export using ``<famname>``  instead of ``<name>``;
   and when set to **Organization**, the EAD will export using ``<corpname>``
   instead of ``<name>``. The ``<name>`` element is the default when no
   entity type is set. For more information on authority records and the ISAAR
   standard upon which the authority record template is based, see:
   :ref:`authority-records` and :ref:`isaar-template`.

.. NOTE::

  In the CSV template, this column can accept multiple values, separated by a
  pipe ``|`` character. The label values will be matched 1:1 with the identifiers.

.. TIP::

   When entering the description manually, the Creator field is found in the
   RAD template  within the Dates of creation :term:`information area`,
   labelled as "Actor name."

.. IMPORTANT::

   When linking a :term:`creator` to an :term:`archival description`,
   you should only link at the highest level of description. AtoM will
   automatically inherit the creator name at lower levels. This conforms to
   RAD's General Rule 1.0A2d *Non-repetition of information*: "Do not repeat
   information at a lower level of description that has already been given at a
   higher level...." Linking a repository at all levels of description (instead
   of just at the parent level) in a large hierarchy can also impact performance.

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

Biographical history
--------------------

**Template field** Biographical history

**CSV Column** ``eventActorHistories``

**RAD Rule** "Record in narrative form or as a chronology the main life events,
activities, achievements and/or roles of the entity being described. This may
include information on gender, nationality, family and religious or political
affiliations. Wherever possible, supply dates as an integral component of the
narrative description." (ISAAR 5.2.2)

See also RAD section 1.7B1.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <bioghist id="[md5 hash]" encodinganalog="1.7B">
      <note>
         <p>

.. NOTE::

   When entering data manually, this field needs to be written in the
   :term:`authority record`. If an authority record does not already exist, AtoM
   will create one when a new creator is entered, above. The user can then
   navigate to the authority record to enter the Biographical or Administrative
   history (see: :ref:`Authority records <authority-records>`).

.. NOTE::

   When importing descriptions by CSV, by default this column will
   create a Biographical history in the :term:`authority record`, regardless of
   whether the creator is a person, family, or organization. To specify the
   entity type when importing creators, users would need to
   :ref:`import authority records <csv-import-authority-records>` or manually edit
   the authority record.

   In the CSV template, this column can accept multiple values, separated by a
   pipe ``|`` character. The label values will be matched 1:1 with the identifiers.

.. NOTE::

   When roundtripping descriptions from one AtoM instance to another, creator
   names in the ``<origination>`` element are matched 1:1 in order with
   administrative or biographical histories included in ``<bioghist>``. It is
   therefore important that if some creators do not have related histories, they
   appear in the EAD **after** those that do, so the 1:1 mapping can work as
   expected. If an extra ``<bioghist>`` element is included that does not have
   a corresponding creator name, a stub :term:`authority record` will be created
   to hold the ``<bioghist>`` data.


:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

.. _template-dates:

Dates of creation area
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When entering data manually, the fields below are accessed by clicking "Add
new" in the dates of creation area.

   :width: 100%
   :alt: An image of the data entry fields for the Dates of Creation area

   The data entry fields for the Dates of Creation area

Entering an actor's name will automatically insert the actor's
biographical sketch or administrative history from the
:term:`authority record`.

When entering data manually, users can choose an event type from a
:term:`drop-down menu`. The event types can be edited by an
:term:`administrator` in the Event types :term:`taxonomy` (see:
:ref:`Add a new term <add-term>`). When importing descriptions via CSV, the
event type defaults to Creation.

Place
-----

**Template field** Place

**CSV Column** N/A

**RAD Rule** "For an item, transcribe the place of publication, distribution,
etc., in the form and grammatical case in which it appears." (RAD 1.4C1).
Search for an existing term in the places taxonomy by typing the first few
characters of the term name. Alternatively, type a new term to create and
link to a new place term.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <controlaccess>
      <geogname role="Creator" encodinganalog="1.4C" id="atom_200823_place">

.. NOTE::

   The above example assumes that the place was linked to a creator, as opposed
   to a publisher, broadcaster, or other role - the ``@role`` attribute value
   will depend on the type of event entered. An example ``@id`` is included
   in this example as well - atom will generate and use these to maintain the
   relationship between a creator name, date, and place when roundtripping.

Date(s)
-------

**Template field** Date

**CSV Column** ``eventDates`` and ``eventTypes``

**RAD Rule** "Give the date(s) of creation of the unit being described either as a
single date, or range of dates (for inclusive dates and/or predominant dates).
Always give the inclusive dates. When providing predominant dates, specify
them as such, preceded by the word predominant..." (1.4B2). Record probable
and uncertain dates in square brackets, using the conventions described in RAD
1.4B5.

**EAD** (creator example)

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unitdate id="[atom-generated-value]" normal="[start date/end date]" encodinganalog="1.4B2">

.. NOTE::

   The CSV column in earlier versions prior to 2.2 was named "creatorDates" -
   it has been updated to clarify its relation to the creation event - not to
   the dates of existence of the creator. However, we have added fallback
   code, so if the old name is used, the import will still succeed.

.. NOTE::

   This field will display the date as intended by the editor of the
   archival description, in the language of the standard being used. The start
   and end date values, which must be ISO-formatted (YYYY-MM-DD), will populate
   the ``@normal`` attribute. AtoM will also generate an ID to be able to link
   the creator name, place, and event date again when roundtripping from one
   AtoM instance to another.

Users can also set the type of event, using the "Event type"
:term:`drop-down menu`. In the RAD :term:`edit page`, the default terms in the
drop-down menu for "Event type" are:

* Creation
* Custody
* Publication
* Contribution
* Collection
* Accumulation
* Reproduction
* Distribution
* Broadcasting
* Manufacturing

AtoM will also add a ``@datechar`` attribute for different types of events. Here
is an example for a broadcasting event date in EAD XML:

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unitdate id="[atom-generated-value]" datechar="broadcasting" normal="[start date/end date]" encodinganalog="1.4F">

:ref:`Back to the top <rad-template>`

Dates of creation - Start
-------------------------

**Template field** Start

**CSV Column** ``eventStartDates``

   :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>` in the future. At this time, it has not been added
   to the CSV import templates.

**RAD Rule** N/A

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <controlaccess>
      <genreform>

.. NOTE::

   The Genre taxonomy comes pre-populated in AtoM with genre/documentary form
   terms. All 45 terms included have been taken from the US Library of
   Congress' "Basic Genre Terms for Cultural Heritage Materials," available
   at: http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/techdocs/genre.html. All terms can be edited
   or deleted by users, and new ones can be added. When using the Genre access
   point field in the RAD template, new values added in this field will create
   :term:`terms <term>` in the Genre :term:`taxonomy` where those do not
   already exist.

.. TIP::

   The Genre terms can be used as a facet in the :ref:`browse` and
   :ref:`search <search-atom>` pages. The label on the facet can be customized
   by an :term:`administrator` via **Admin > Settings > User interface labels**.
   See: :ref:`user-interface-labels`.


Name access points
------------------

**Template field** Name access points

**CSV Column** ``nameAccessPoints``

**RAD Rule** "Choose provenance, author and other non-subject access points from
the archival description, as appropriate. All access points must be apparent
from the archival description to which they relate." (RAD 21.0B) The values in
this field are drawn from the Authorized form of name field in authority
records. Search for an existing name by typing the first few characters of the
name. Alternatively, type a new name to create and link to a new authority
record.

**EAD**

If the entity type of the actor is not defined as either a person, family, or
corporate body:

.. code-block:: xml

   <controlaccess>
      <name role="subject">

.. NOTE::

   This is the default export EAD when an Entity type has not been set for the
   actor on the related :term:`authority record`. The final EAD element can be
   more precise, if the user has entered an Entity type on the related
   :term:`authority record`. When the Entity type is set to **Person**, the EAD
   will export using ``<persname>`` instead of  ``<name>``; when set to
   **Family**, the EAD will export using ``<famname>``  instead of ``<name>``;
   and when set to **Organization**, the EAD will export using ``<corpname>``
   instead of ``<name>``. The ``<name>`` element is the default when no
   entity type is set. For more information on authority records and the ISAAR
   standard upon which the authority record template is based, see:
   :ref:`authority-records` and :ref:`isaar-template`.

   This field is an auto-complete - the :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` will
   suggest existing authority records as you type. Values in this column/field
   that are entered instead of selected from the drop-down will create new
   :term:`authority records <authority record>`.
