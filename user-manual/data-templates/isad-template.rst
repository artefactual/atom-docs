   The data entry fields for the Identity area using the ISAD(G) template,
   including Identifier, Title, Dates, Level of description, Add new child
   levels and extent and medium.

Reference code
--------------

**Template field** Identifier

**CSV Column** ``identifier``

**ISAD Rule** Provide a specific local reference code, control number, or other unique identifier.
The country and repository code will be automatically added from the linked repository record to form a full reference code.
(ISAD 3.1.1)

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unitid encodinganalog="3.1.1">

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the "inherit reference code" settings in **Admin > Settings > Global**, this field can display to non-logged in users as "Reference code."
   While editing the record, the full reference code including any identifiers :ref:`inherited <inherit-reference-code>` from higher levels will appear below the Identifier field.


:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

Alternative identifier
----------------------

**Template field** Add alternative identifier(s) (toggles open using link beneath identifier field)

**CSV Columns** ``alternativeIdentifiers`` and ``alternativeIdentifierLabels``

**ISAD Rule** N/A (see note below)

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unitid type="alternative" label="[user entered value]">

.. NOTE::

   The use of the alternative identifier fields is documented in full here:

   * :ref:`add-alternative-id`

   In the CSV templates, the columns can accept multiple values, separated by a
   pipe ``|`` character. The label values will be matched 1:1 with the
   identifiers.

:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

.. _isad-title:

Title
-----

**Template field** Title

**CSV Column** ``title``

**ISAD Rule** Provide either a formal title or a concise supplied title in
accordance with the rules of multilevel description and national
conventions. (ISAD 3.1.2)

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <unittitle encodinganalog="3.1.2">

.. NOTE::

   The EAD tag ``<titleproper encodinganalog="title">`` refers to the
   title of the finding aid, not the archival description.

:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

.. _isad-dates:

Date(s)
-------

**Template field** Date(s)

**CSV Columns** ``eventDates``, ``eventTypes``, ``eventStartDates``, and ``eventEndDates``

**ISAD Rule** Identify and record the date(s) of the unit of description.
Identify the type of date given. Record as a single date or a range of dates
as appropriate." (ISAD 3.1.3) The Date Display field can be used to
enter free-text date information, including typographical marks to express
approximation, uncertainty, or qualification.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
     <unitdate encodinganalog="3.1.3">

.. NOTE::

   When entering data in the template, users can choose an event type from a
   :term:`drop-down menu`. The event types in ISAD(G) are Creation and
   Accumulation. When importing descriptions via CSV, use the ``eventTypes`` column.

   AtoM will also add a ``datechar`` attribute for different types of events.
   Here is an example for as accumulation event date in EAD XML:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <did>
        <unitdate id="[atom-generated-value]" datechar="accumulation" normal="[start date/end date]" encodinganalog="3.1.3">

.. NOTE::

  If multiple dates are being added, the content across all date fields must be
  written in the same order with the pipe character ``|`` used as a separator.
  For example, in a description with two dates where the first date is a creation event
  and the second date is an accumulation event, enter the following:

  +-------------------------+---------------------------+
  | eventDates              | eventTypes                |
  +=========================+===========================+
  | 2000-2001 | 1983-1984   | Creation | Accumulation   |
  +-------------------------+---------------------------+

.. NOTE::

   The CSV columns in 2.2 were titled ``creationDates`` and ``creationDatesType``.
   Prior to 2.2, there was one CSV column called ``creatorDates``.
   We have added fallback code so if the old name is used the import will still succeed.

:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

.. _isad-lod:

Level of description
--------------------

**Template field** Level of description

**CSV Column** ``levelOfDescription``

**ISAD Rule** Record the level of this unit of description. (ISAD 3.1.4)

**EAD**

At the parent level:

.. code-block:: xml

   <archdesc level="[level of description]" relatedencoding="ISAD(G)v2">


At the child level:

.. code-block:: xml

   <dsc type="combined">
      <c level="[name of level]">

.. NOTE::

   An :term:`administrator` can edit the values in the Levels of
   description :term:`taxonomy` (see: :ref:`Add a new term <add-term>`). In
   CSV import, if a term is used that is not already in the taxonomy, it will
   be added to the Levels of description taxonomy.


:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

.. _isad-add-child-widget:

Add new child levels
--------------------

.. image:: images/add-new-child-widget.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Add new child widget in ISAD

**Template field** Identifier, Level, Title, Date

**CSV Column** N/A - See notes below

**ISAD Rule** *Identifier*: Provide a specific local reference code, control
number, or other unique identifier.

*Level of description*: Record the level of this unit of description.

*Title*: Provide either a formal title or a concise supplied title in accordance
with the rules of multilevel description and national conventions.

*Date*: (Works similarly to the display date field for a date of creation; see
:ref:`above <isad-dates>` for more information.)

**EAD** See the EAD mappings in the related fields above.

.. NOTE::

   This widget has been added to help improve workflows when creating new
   descriptions via the :term:`user interface`. When entering descriptions
   through the form, users can add new :term:`child records <child record>` in
   this area while creating a parent record.

   The *dates* field corresponds to a date of creation - if you would like a
   different kind of date, you will have to either navigate to the child
   description after saving the new :term:`parent record`, and change the date
   type, or simply ignore the date field in the widget, and add the correct
   date type manually to the child record after saving the new parent record.

.. IMPORTANT::

   To include child levels in the ISAD CSV for import, the ``parentId`` column
   must contain the legacy ID of the parent record. For example, if the parent
   record has the legacy ID *249* recorded in the ``legacyId`` column, the child
   record must have the number *249* in the ``parentId`` column, as shown in
   the table here:

       +--------------------+------------+----------+
       | title              | legacyId   | parentId |
       +====================+============+==========+
       | ISAD Collection    | 249        |          |
       +--------------------+------------+----------+
       | ISAD child level   | 250        | 249      |
       +--------------------+------------+----------+

   Fill out subsequent fields following the same rules as described for parent
   records.

Extent and medium
-----------------

**Template field** Extent and medium

**CSV Column** ``extentAndMedium``

**ISAD Rule** "Record the extent of the unit of description by giving the number
of physical or logical units in Arabic numerals and the unit of measurement.
Give the specific medium (media) of the unit of description. Separate
multiple extents with a linebreak. (ISAD 3.1.5)"

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <physdesc encodinganalog="3.1.5">

.. NOTE::

   AtoM will allow users to add additional EAD subelements to :term:`field` in
   the :term:`edit page` to accommodate all the possibilities in EAD for more
   granularity, such as ``<extent>``, ``<dimensions>``, ``<physfacet>``, and
   ``<genreform>``. In the :term:`view page` the EAD tags will be hidden, but
   preserved during export and re-import.

   The data entry fields for the Context area using the ISAD(G) template,
   including Name of creator(s), Repository, Archival history and Immediate
   source of acquisition or transfer.


Name of creator(s)
------------------

**Template field** Name of creator(s)

**CSV Column** ``eventActors``

**ISAD Rule** Record the name of the organization(s) or the individual(s)
responsible for the creation, accumulation and maintenance of the records in
the unit of description. Search for an existing name in the authority
records by typing the first few characters of the name. Alternatively, type
a new name to create and link to a new authority record. (ISAD 3.2.1)

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <origination encodinganalog="3.2.1">
      <name>

.. NOTE::

   This is the default export EAD when an Entity type has not been set for the
   actor on the related :term:`authority record`. The final EAD element can be
   more precise if the user has entered an Entity type on the related
   :term:`authority record`. When the Entity type is set to **Person**, the EAD
   will export using ``<persname>`` instead of ``<name>``; when set to
   **Family**, the EAD will export using ``<famname>``  instead of ``<name>``;
   and when set to **Organization**, the EAD will export using ``<corpname>``
   instead of ``<name>``. The ``<name>`` element is the default when no
   entity type is set. For more information on authority records and the ISAAR
   standard upon which the authority record template is based, see:
   :ref:`authority-records` and :ref:`isaar-template`.

.. NOTE::

  If multiple creators are being added, the content in related fields must be
  written in the same order with the pipe character ``|`` as a separator. It is
  possible to use ``NULL`` to include an empty element in related fields. For
  example, in a description with two creators where the first creator does not
  have a biographical history but the second creator does, enter the following:

  +---------------------------+-------------------------------+
  | eventActors               | eventActorHistories           |
  +===========================+===============================+
  | Creator 1 | Creator 2     | NULL | Creator 2 bioghist     |
  +---------------------------+-------------------------------+

.. IMPORTANT::

  When linking a :term:`creator` to an :term:`archival description`,
  you should only link at the highest level of description. AtoM will
  automatically inherit the creator name at lower levels. This conforms to
  ISAD(G)'s Multilevel Description Rule 2.4, *Non-repetition of information*: "At
  the highest appropriate level, give information that is common to the component
  parts. Do not repeat information at a lower level of description that has
  already been given at a higher level." Linking a creator at all levels of
  description (instead of just at the parent level) in a large hierarchy can also
  impact performance.

:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

Biographical or Administrative history
--------------------------------------

**Template field** N/A

**CSV Column** ``eventActorHistories``

**ISAD Rule** "Record in narrative form or as a chronology the main life events,
activities, achievements and/or roles of the entity being described. This may
include information on gender, nationality, family and religious or political
affiliations. Wherever possible, supply dates as an integral component of the
narrative description." (ISAAR 5.2.2)

**EAD**

.. code-block:: none

   <bioghist id=[md5 hash]>
      <note>
         <p>

.. NOTE::

   When entering data manually, this field is written in the
   :term:`authority record`. If an authority record does not already exist, AtoM
   will create one when a new creator is entered. The user can then
   navigate to the authority record to enter the Biographical or Administrative
   history (see: :ref:`Authority records <authority-records>`).

   When importing descriptions by CSV, by default this column will create a
   Biographical history in the :term:`authority record`, regardless of whether
   the creator is a person, family, or organization. To specify the entity type
   when importing creators, users would need to
   :ref:`import authority records <csv-import-authority-records>` or manually edit
   the authority record.

.. NOTE::

   When roundtripping descriptions from one AtoM instance to another, creator
   names in the ``<origination>`` element are matched 1:1 in order with
   administrative or biographical histories included in ``<bioghist>``. It is
   therefore important that if some creators do not have related histories, they
   appear in the EAD **after** those that do, so the 1:1 mapping can work as
   expected. If an extra ``<bioghist>`` element is included that does not have
   a corresponding creator name, a stub :term:`authority record` will be created
   to hold the ``<bioghist>`` data.

:ref:`Back to the top <isad-template>`

Repository
----------

**Template field** Repository

**CSV Column** ``repository``

**ISAD Rule** Record the name of the organization which has custody of the
archival material. Search for an existing name in the archival institution
records by typing the first few characters of the name. Alternatively, type
a new name to create and link to a new archival institution record.

**EAD**

.. code-block:: xml

   <did>
      <repository>
         <corpname>

.. NOTE::

   When an address is included in the related :term:`archival institution` (i.e.
   added to the Contact area of the linked repository record), the address will
   also appear in the EAD at the parent level. Because EAD does not include
   attributes for the ``<addressline>`` element, these will not roundtrip properly
   when exported from one AtoM instance and into another - all the information
   will appear in one field of the Contact area upon re-import. Below is an
   example of the EAD with an address included:

   .. code-block:: xml

     <repository>
        <corpname>Artefactual Archives</corpname>
        <address>
           <addressline>Suite 201 – 301 6th Street</addressline>
           <addressline>New Westminster</addressline>
           <addressline>British Columbia</addressline>
           <addressline>Canada</addressline>
           <addressline>Telephone: (604)527-2056</addressline>
           <addressline>Email: info@artefactual.com</addressline>
           <addressline>http://www.artefactual.com</addressline>
        </address>
     </repository>

.. IMPORTANT::

   When linking an :term:`archival institution` to an :term:`archival description`,
   you should only link at the highest level of description. AtoM will
   automatically inherit the repository name at lower levels. This conforms to
   ISAD(G)'s Multilevel Description Rule 2.4, *Non-repetition of information*: "At
   the highest appropriate level, give information that is common to the component
   parts. Do not repeat information at a lower level of description that has
   already been given at a higher level." Linking a repository at all levels of
   description (instead of just at the parent level) in a large hierarchy can also
   impact performance.

Archival history
----------------

**Template field** Archival history

**CSV Column** ``archivalHistory``

**ISAD Rule** Record the successive transfers of ownership, responsibility
and/or custody of the unit of description and indicate those actions, such
as history of the arrangement, production of contemporary finding aids, re-
use of the records for other purposes or software migrations, that have
contributed to its present structure and arrangement. Give the dates of
these actions, insofar as they can be ascertained. If the archival history
is unknown, record that information. (ISAD 3.2.3)

   This is the default export EAD when an Entity type has not been set for the

   more precise, if the user has entered an Entity type on the related
   :term:`authority record`. When the Entity type is set to **Person**, the EAD
   will export using ``<persname>`` instead of  ``<name>``; when set to
   **Family**, the EAD will export using ``<famname>``  instead of ``<name>``;
   and when set to **Organization**, the EAD will export using ``<corpname>``
   instead of ``<name>``. The ``<name>`` element is the default when no
   entity type is set. For more information on authority records and the ISAAR
   standard upon which the authority record template is based, see:
   :ref:`authority-records` and :ref:`isaar-template`.

   This field is an auto-complete - the :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` will
