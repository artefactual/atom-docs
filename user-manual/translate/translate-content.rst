To translate the content of an :term:`archival description`,
:term:`authority record`, :term:`archival institution`, or :term:`term`, a user
with translation privileges will open the translate user interface dialog and
work within it.

1. Log in with an account that has translation privileges. For more
   information, see: :ref:`user-roles`, :ref:`manage-user-accounts`, and
   :ref:`edit-user-permissions`.
2. Start in your default language (e.g., English). Navigate to the content
   you want to translate into another language (e.g., archival description).
   For more information on navigation in AtoM, see: :ref:`access-content`.
3. You have two choices for doing the same thing:

   * click :term:`edit button` and then navigate to the |globe2|
     :ref:`language menu <language-menu>` in the :term:`header bar` and select
     the language you wish to translate your content into or,
   * navigate to the |globe2| :ref:`language menu <language-menu>` in the
     :term:`header bar` and then click the :term:`edit button`

4. In the above example, the language selected for translation is French and the
   user is translating content in an :term:`archival description`. Note the
   :term:`translation bar` is visible at the bottom of the page.
   Ignore it for now.
5. Begin translating the content of the archival description in
   :term:`edit mode` by selecting one of the :term:`information area` and
   typing into the data entry :term:`fields <field>`. Note that the content is
   shown in the source language above the data entry :term:`field`.

.. TIP::

   The tooltips (e.g., ISAD) may also be shown in the new language if they
   have been translated by our community of volunteer translators. For more 
   information, including how you can contribute translations included in 
   public releases, see the 
   `translation instructions <https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/Translation>`__ 
   on our wiki.

6. Repeat for each field as required.
7. Click the save button in the :term:`button block`
8. AtoM returns the user to the :term:`view mode`. The translated fields will
   now appear in the new language of translation. Any content not yet
   translated will continue to appear in the source language.
