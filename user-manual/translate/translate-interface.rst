To translate the :term:`user interface` it is important to understand that
the :term:`user interface` is the set of elements that allow the user to
interact with the AtoM application. These elements include the
:term:`main menu`, :term:`drop-down menus <drop-down menu>`,
:term:`context menus <context menu>`, :term:`title bars <title bar>`,
:term:`column headers <column header>`, :term:`button blocks <button block>`,
:term:`field labels <field label>`, and other recurring elements that are used
to navigate AtoM or to search for, view, add, modify, and delete
:term:`database content`.

The following instructions are for translating the :term:`user interface`
locally. AtoM ships with some user interface translations that are kindly
provided by community volunteers, and managed via a web-based
translation management application. If you would like to contribute your interface
translations to a future release instead of translating locally, we welcome
your contributions - please see our guide to getting started:
 
* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/Translation. 

**To translate the AtoM user interface locally:**

1. Log in with an account that has translation privileges. For more
   information, see: :ref:`user-roles`, :ref:`manage-user-accounts`, and
   :ref:`edit-user-permissions`.
2. Start in your default language (e.g., English). Navigate to the |globe2|
   :ref:`language menu <language-menu>` in the :term:`header bar` and select
   the language you want to translate the :term:`user interface` into.

3. AtoM will reload the page with the :term:`translation bar` at the bottom
   of the page. This example shows the :term:`translation bar` in French.

5. Click on the Translate User Interface button in the :term:`translation bar`
   to open the :term:`translation panel` in the lower frame of the page.

6. The :term:`translation panel` is organized into three columns:

   * **First column**: Page text lists all the elements that are translated, or
     available for translation.
   * **Second column**: Source is the name of the element in the source language.
     In this example it is shown in English.
   * **Third Column**: Translation shows the translated element, or it is empty
     and waiting for the user to type a translation into it.

7. Select an element for translation from the first column.
8. Provide the translation for the element in the third column.
9. Click on the Save Translation button when you are finished. AtoM will
   close the :term:`translation panel`. All :term:`user interface` elements
   on the page should now appear as translated.

.. NOTE::

   Some element names include a number enclosed by percent sign (e.g., %1%).
   this is a template token indicating a variable whose value is dynamically
   generated by the context in which the termplate is displayed. Tokens are
   represented by a number enclosed in percent signs. Tokens must be included
   in the translation, but because different languages have different grammar
   rules, translators ned to be aware of the type of information being handled
   in any given variable in any given context.
