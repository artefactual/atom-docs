Edit permissions
================

User permissions define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from
view-only access to full administration rights. These :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>`, or *Permissions*, can be navigated by :ref:`user-roles`,
which are defined by "Groups" that an authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can add and edit (see :ref:`manage-user-accounts`). When a
specific user is assigned to a "Group", he/she automatically inherits the
access privileges of that user group. However, administrators can also edit the
access privileges of a specific user if they wish. Each access privilege can
be edited either by **User** or by **Group**; the sections below have been
drafted in a way that reflects these options.

**Below you'll find instructions on how to:**

Default user permissions settings in AtoM
=========================================

When a new user or user group is created in AtoM, they are automatically
assigned default user permission settings. These permissions will affect the way
they can view, edit, and interact with different :doc:`Entity types
<../overview/entity-types>` in the system: for example, by default, a
:term:`researcher` or public user of the system can only Read archival
descriptions, authority records, archival institutions and terms. In AtoM,
default user permissions consist of both default :ref:`access privileges
<default-access-privileges>` and default :ref:`permissions based on user roles
<default-permissions-by-role>`: in the previous example, "Read" is the access
privilege and the "Researcher" is the user role. These permissions can only be
edited (i.e. Granted or Denied) by an authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator`.

.. _default-access-privileges:

Default access privileges
-------------------------

An authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can view and edit :term:`access privileges <access
privilege>` of either a group or a user by navigating between 4 different
:term:`permissions tabs <permissions tab>`:

* :ref:`Archival description permissions <description-default-actions>`
* :ref:`Authority record permissions <authority-default-actions>`
* :ref:`Taxonomy permissions <taxonomy-default-actions>`
* :ref:`Archival institution permissions <institution-default-actions>`

Clicking on a specific :term:`permissions tab` will direct you to the
:term:`view page` of that permission, where the :term:`access privileges <access
privilege>` for that permission will be displayed under a :term:`field` labeled
as *Action*. An authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can edit
access privileges by switching from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode`;
simply click the :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button
block`.

.. NOTE::

   An authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` must be in
   :term:`edit mode` in order to be able to view and edit *all* :term:`access
   privileges <access privilege>` that are available for a specific
   :term:`permissions tab` In :term:`view mode`, only those actions which
   are not indicated as "Inherit", or in default, will be displayed.

Access privileges, or *Actions* will vary according to the permission type (i.e.
the :term:`permissions tab`) that has been selected. Because each permission
type has a different list of default *Actions*, permission-specific instructions
have been included below.

.. _description-default-actions:

Archival description privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/description-actions.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of default actions in Archival description permissions

The "Archival description permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will
display the specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be
maintained for users interacting with an :term:`archival institution's <archival
institution>` :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. Specific
privileges can be set with regards to reading, creating, updating, deleting,
viewing drafts, publishing, accessing master copies and/or accessing reference
copies of either *all* archival descriptions, specific archival descriptions, or
*all* archival descriptions of a specific institution.

.. NOTE::

   In order to fully test the option of setting specific :term:`access
   privileges <access privilege>` for *all* :term:`archival descriptions
   <archival description>` linked to a specific :term:`archival institution`,
   you should have two or more archival institutions in your system, with
   several hierarchical descriptions attached and some digital objects uploaded.

A authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can **Grant** or **Deny**
a user's access privileges to a specific *Action*, or administrators can rely on
the default permissions as they are established by AtoM by selecting a default
user "Group". For more information on default access settings, see:
:ref:`below <default-permissions-by-role>`.

.. _authority-default-actions:

Authority record privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/authority-actions.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of default actions in Authority record permissions

The "Authority record permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will display
the specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be maintained
for users interacting with an :term:`archival institution's <archival
institution>` :term:`authority records <authority record>`. Specific privileges
can be set with regards to reading, creating, updating, and deleting either
*all* authority records or specific authority records
belonging to an archival institution. A authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can **Grant** or **Deny** a user's access privileges to a
specific *Action*, or administrators can rely on the default permissions as
they are established by AtoM by selecting a default user "Group". For more
information on default access settings, see: :ref:`below
<default-permissions-by-role>`.

.. _taxonomy-default-actions:

Taxonomy privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/taxonomy-actions.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of default actions in Taxonomy permissions

The "Taxonomy permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will display the
specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be maintained for
users interacting with :term:`terms <term>` and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>`.
Specific privileges can be set with regards to creating, updating, and deleting
either *all* terms, or specific taxonomies. A authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can **Grant** or **Deny** a user's access privileges to
a specific *Action*, or administrators can rely on the default permissions as
they are established by AtoM by selecting a default user "Group". For more
information on default access settings, see: :ref:`below
<default-permissions-by-role>`.

.. _institution-default-actions:

Archival institution privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/institution-actions.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of default actions in Archival institution permissions

.. NOTE::

   In order to fully test the scenarios in this section, you should have two or
   more archival institutions in your system, with several hierarchical
   descriptions attached and some digital objects uploaded.

The "Archival institution permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will
display the specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be
maintained for users interacting with an :term:`archival institution's <archival
institution>` settings. Specific privileges can be set with regards to reading,
creating, updating, and deleting the settings for either *all* the archival
institutions linked to one system, or a specific archival institution linked to
one system. A authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can **Grant**
or **Deny** a user's access privileges to a specific *Action*, or administrators
can rely on the default permissions as they are established by AtoM by selecting
a default user "Group". For more information on default access settings, see:
:ref:`below <default-permissions-by-role>`.

:ref:`Back to top <edit-user-permissions>`

.. _default-permissions-by-role:

Default permissions by user role
--------------------------------

When creating a new user in AtoM, the user account can be tied to one of 5
default "User groups":

* :ref:`Researcher <researcher-default>`
* :ref:`Administrator <administrator-default>`
* :ref:`Editor <editor-default>`
* :ref:`Contributor <contributor-default>`
* :ref:`Translator <translator-default>`

Each user group contains default :term:`access privileges <access privilege>`,
or *Actions* that define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from
view-only access to full administration rights. Each *Action* includes the
option to select one of the following three :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>`, or *Permission*, displayed as radio buttons:

* Grant |grant|
* Deny |deny|
* Inherit |inherit|

.. |grant| image:: images/grant.png
   :height: 23
   :width: 65

.. |deny| image:: images/deny.png
   :height: 23
   :width: 65

.. |inherit| image:: images/inherit.png

   :height: 23
   :width: 65

.. |dash| image:: images/dash.png
   :height: 23
   :width: 20

Access privileges, or *Actions* will vary according to the permission type
(i.e. the :term:`permissions tab`) that has been selected. Because each
permission type has a different list of default *Permissions*,
this section lists permission-specific instructions have been included below.

.. NOTE::

   Default permission settings will be displayed in 2 ways in AtoM: when viewing
   permission settings in :term:`edit mode`, "Inherit" |inherit-select| will
   automatically be selected when the default setting has been chosen by an
   :term:`administrator` for a specific action; when viewing permission settings
   in :term:`view mode`, AtoM will simply display a dash |dash| in place of
   "Inherit" when the default setting has been chosen by an
   :term:`administrator` for a specific action.

For more information on user roles, see: :ref:`user-roles`.

.. _researcher-default:

Default settings: Researcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In AtoM, "Researchers" refer to unauthenticated (i.e. non-logged in) users
and/or public users. By default, these types of users are limited to searching
and browsing descriptions.

Creating a user group of "Researchers" will automatically assign the above
default :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` to that group. However,
the access privileges of individual users in that user group can still be
edited without it altering the overall privileges of that group as a whole.

.. _administrator-default:

Default settings: Administrator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An :term:`administrator` is a type of user who has :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>` to install or uninstall AtoM, customize AtoM to
institution-specific requirements or themes, and manage :term:`user
accounts <user account>` and :term:`user profiles <user profile>` for both
groups and individual users. By default, administrators are granted permission
for almost all access privileges.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike other user types, a translator is a type of user who has permission to
edit the content in your AtoM system. Their :term:`access privileges <access
privilege>`, however, are limited to translating and viewing records.

Creating a user group of "Translators" will automatically assign the above
default :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` to that group. However,
the access privileges of individual users in that user group can still be
edited without it altering the overall privileges of that group as a whole.

.. _description-permissions:

Setting permissions by archival description
===========================================

:term:`Access privileges <access privilege>` for :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>` and :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`
can be edited according to both users and groups;
they can be granted, denied, or :term:`administrators <administrator>` can rely
on the default (i.e."Inherit") setting as set by AtoM. Specific permissions can
be set for *all* archival descriptions, or edited based on specific archival
descriptions and/or archival institutions.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Only an authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can modify a
   user's or a group's :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` or
   *Permissions*. After the desired changes have been made, the administrator
   can log out and log back in as that specific user in order to verify the
   results of the modifications.

.. _user-info-object-permissions:

Edit archival description permissions by user
---------------------------------------------

You may want to edit a specific user's access privilege with regards to
archival descriptions: for example, you may wish to give a user the ability to
translate to specified language; or in a multi-repository, you may want to
enable a user to create, update, edit, delete and publish only *one* archival
description belonging to the archival institution. Follow the instructions below
to edit user permissions by archival description.

.. NOTE::

   When navigating AtoM by user profiles, the "Archival description permissions"
   :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will appear as an "Information object
   permissions" tab.

1. First, navigate to an existing user in AtoM. You can do this by clicking the
   |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menu in the :term:`main menu` located
   in the :term:`header bar` and selecting "Users" from the
   :term:`drop-down menu`. This will take you to a list of
   current users accounts (i.e. the "List users" page).
2. By default, the list that appears will be of all "Active" users (i.e. "Show
   Active only"). Select whether you wish to view "Active" users or "Inactive"
   users (i.e. "Show Inactive only"). All :term:`usernames <username>` will
   appear in alphabetical order.
3. You can find the user you wish to edit by using the "Search users" box
   located at the top of the "List users" page, or by navigating through the
   list by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking through the page
   numbers. Click on the user's user name to be redirected to that
   :term:`user's profile <user profile>` :term:`view page`.
4. By clicking on the "Information object permissions" :term:`information area`,
   you will be directed to the :term:`permissions tab` :term:`view page` where
   the "Archival description permissions" for that particular user will be
   displayed.
5. To edit user permissions, click the :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in
   the :term:`button block`. On loading, the :term:`edit page` will display the
   :ref:`Actions <description-default-actions>` and :ref:`Permissions
   <default-permissions-by-role>` for that user with regards to *All archival
   descriptions* belonging to your archival institution. *Permissions* can
   be edited (i.e. **Grant** or **Deny**) as required.

   If you wish to **only** edit the user's permissions for *All archival
   descriptions*, please skip steps 6 through 9 and **proceed to step 10**.

.. NOTE::

   Changes made in the "Permissions for all archival description"
   :term:`information area` will be applied to *all* archival descriptions
   belonging to your institution. Follow **steps 6 through 9** below if you wish
   to edit a user's :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` based on a
   specific :term:`archival description <archival description>` and/or
   :term:`archival institution <archival institution>`.

6. A user's :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` can also be edited
   according to a specific *archival description* or *archival institution*. To
   do this, click on either the "Permissions by archival description"
   or "Permisisons by archival institution" :term:`information area` to access
   the :term:`fields <field>` under them.
7. To specify a user's access privileges for one or
   more specific :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, click on
   "Add archival description".

   To specify a user's access privileges for one or
   more specific :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, click on
   "Add archival institution".

.. IMPORTANT::

   To limit a user's access privileges to one or more specific archival institutions,
   the user must **not** be in one of the predefined user groups (i.e. editor or contributor).
   Instead, ensure that the user's group is listed as *authenticated*.

8. A separate window will appear. An :term:`archival description` can be added
   via a :term:`value list` that appears in a :term:`drop-down menu` - as you
   type, the value list will narrow its options to present related suggestions.

   An :term:`archival institution` can be added via the same means, under the
   "Permissions by archival institution" :term:`information area`.
9. Once you've added an *archival description* or an *archival institution*, the
   page will load the :ref:`default *Actions* and *Permissions*
   <description-default-actions>` for that user with regards to the archival
   description or the archival institution you have selected. Permissions can be
   edited as required.

.. NOTE::

   In order to fully test the scenarios in this section, you should have two or
   more :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` in your system,
   with several hierarchical
   :term:`descriptions <archival description>` attached and some digital objects
   uploaded.

10. You can quit the process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
    in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
    simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
    clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the user

repository, you may want to update only the archival descriptions belonging to
one specific archival institution. Follow the instructions below to edit group
permissions by archival description.

1. Navigate to an existing group in AtoM. You can do this by clicking the
   |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menu in the :term:`main menu` located
   in the :term:`header bar` and selecting "Groups" from the
   :term:`drop-down menu`. This will take you to a list of current user groups.
2. Select a group from the list that appears on the page by clicking on the
   group name. AtoM will direct you to that user group's :term:`view page`.
3. Click on the "Archival description permissions" :term:`information area`.

   page`.
4. To switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode`, click the
   :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button block`; this takes
   you to the group's :term:`edit page` for this :term:`access privilege`.
5. On loading, the :term:`edit page` will display the default *Actions* and
   *Permissions* for that group as "Inherit" for *All archival descriptions*
   belonging to your archival institution. *Permissions* can be edited (i.e.
   **Grant** or **Deny**) as required.

   If you wish to **only** edit the group's permissions for *All archival
   descriptions*, please skip steps 6 through 9 and **proceed to step 10**.

.. _institution-permissions:

Setting permissions by archival institution
===========================================

In AtoM, an :term:`archival institution` provide users with
the means of managing information about :term:`repositories <repository>`
and other institutions and organizations that hold archival materials or
other cultural heritage items and artifacts. Users and user groups can Read and
potentially Create, Update and Delete archival institutions when given
permission.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Only an authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can modify a
   user's or a group's :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` or
   *Permissions*. After the desired changes have been made, the administrator
   can log out and log back in as that specific user in order to verify the
   results of the modifications.

For more information, jump to the following sections:
  * :ref:`Edit permissions for a user <user-institution-permissions>`
  * :ref:`Edit permissions for a group <group-institution-permissions>`

For more information on archival institutions, see
:ref:`archival-institutions`.

.. NOTE::

   In order to fully test the scenarios in this section, you should have two or
   more archival institutions in your system.
