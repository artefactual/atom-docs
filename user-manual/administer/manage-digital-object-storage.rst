Manage digital object storage
=============================

Digital objects are computer files that can be uploaded into and displayed by
AtoM. They include scanned images, digital photographs, sound and moving image
files, and other scanned or born-digital items.

Digital objects can only be edited and added by an authenticated (i.e. logged-
in) :term:`administrator`.

For more information on :term:`digital objects <digital object>`, see
:ref:`upload-digital-object` or :ref:`upload-limit`.

Manage digital object storage per institution
=============================================

#. Navigate to the :term:`archival institution` whose digital object storage you
   would like to manage. You can do
   this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :doc:`searching <../access-content/search-atom>` for the archival
   institution - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.

#. In the "Upload limit" menu, click the "Edit" link. A dialogue box will appear
   that will allow for 1 of 3 options:

   * **Disable uploads** will prevent users from uploading any digital objects.
   * **Limit uploads to _____ GB** will allow an administrator to set a specific
     upload limit per :term:`archival institution`.
   * **Allow unlimited uploads** is the default setting in AtoM that places no
     restrictions on an authenticated user's digital object uploads.

#. You can quit the edit process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button;
   any data already entered will not be saved.
#. Once the administrator has configured the choices, click "Save." You will
   then be redirected to the Archival institution's :term:`view page`. The
   changes made will be displayed accordingly:

   * If you selected **Disable uploads**, the Upload limit bar will
     automatically be removed and the Upload limit section will indicate that
     the uploads have been disabled.
   * If you selected **Allow unlimited uploads**, the Upload limit bar will
     automatically be removed and the Upload limit section will indicate the
     institution's current uploaded amount, as well as the limit, which will be
     *Unlimited* (e.g. "2.65 GB of *Unlimited*").
   * If you selected a specific number of GB as an upload limit, that number
     will appear below the Upload limit bar, alongside the institution's current
     uploaded amount (e.g. "2.56 of 10 GB").

#. Additional changes to the Upload limit can be made at any time by following
   these steps.
