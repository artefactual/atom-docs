AtoM includes a menu customization feature that allows authenticated (i.e.
logged-in) :term:`administrators <administrator>` to manage menu labels; menus
can be edited, created, moved menus to different positions on the page, deleted
as necessary.

To view a list of menus, click the |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menu
in the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar` and select "Menus"
from the :term:`drop-down menu`.

.. _add-menu:

Add a new menu
==============

An authenticated (i.e. logged in) :term:`administrator` with edit privileges can
edit or update a menu type at any time. Users may add new menus to link to items
such as new static pages or external URLs. Users could also add menus to link to
new actions or modules (such as new edit templates), but such actions or modules
would need to be created first by developers working directly with the code.

For more information on edit privileges and user roles see: :ref:`User roles
<user-roles>`. For information on logging in, see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.

**To add a menu in AtoM:**

1. Navigate to the menu list: click on the |gears| :ref:`Admin
   <main-menu-admin>` menu in the :term:`main menu` located in the
   :term:`header bar` and select "Menus" from the :term:`drop-down menu`.
   AtoM will direct you to the "Site menu list" :term:`view page`.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the :term:`Add new button` in
   the :term:`button block`.
3. AtoM takes you to a blank :term:`edit page` for data entry. On loading, the
   :term:`edit page` displays all the :term:`information areas
   <information area>`.
4. Enter data in the blank :term:`field <field>` located below the information
   area headings.

* In the "Name" :term:`field`, enter a name for the menu.
* In the "Label" :term:`field`, enter a label (this does not need to be
  the same as the "Name").
* In the "Parent" :term:`field`, select a parent menu from the
  :term:`drop-down menu`.
* In the "Path" :term:`field`, enter the URL for the menu.
* In the "Description" :term:`field`, enter descriptive information about
  the menu if desired.

5. You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel"
   button in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be
   saved, and no new menu will be created. Note that simply navigating away
   from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
   also result in no new record being created.
6. To save the new menu, click the "Save" button in the :term:`button block`.
7. AtoM will redirect you to the main page. The new menu should be visible and
   should link to your static page or external URL.
