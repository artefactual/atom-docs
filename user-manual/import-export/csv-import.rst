Most often understood as an acronym for "comma-separated values" (though
sometimes called "character-separated values" because the separator character
does not have to be a comma), CSV is a file format that stores tabular data in
plain-text form. Information with common properties that can be expressed as a
sequence of fields sharing a common header can be stored in plain-text using
the CSV format, making it application agnostic and highly transportable.

A CSV file consists of a number of records (rows), that have identical fields,
separated by commas (or in some cases, another separator). Often a header
column (i.e. the cell values in first or top row of a CSV file) is included,
naming each column and indicating what kind of data the column contains. Data
is then entered using a separator or delimitor (such as a comma) to indicate a
separation of fields (or cells), and a line break or carriage return to
indicate rows (i.e. different records). Most spreadsheet applications (such as
OpenOffice Calc or MS Excel) can open CSV files and express them as a
spreadsheet. See
`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`__ for more
information on CSV.

**In AtoM**, the CSV import function allows user to import data from a
spreadsheet, or another database (so long as the export from the database is
in CSV format). Artefactual has created a number of
:ref:`CSV templates <csv-column-mapping>` that can be used to import

For **small data imports** (i.e. CSV files with less than 1,000 rows), CSV files
that have been mapped to the sample templates provided
(:ref:`below <csv-column-mapping>`) can be imported via the :term:`user
interface`.

For **large data imports** (i.e. CSV files with 1,000 or more rows), the
import will need to be performed using the Command-line interface (CLI) -
meaning you will need access to your installation environment and some basic
familiarity with using the command line.

.. _csv-before-you-import:

Before you import
=================

Before you start importing records, there are a number of things you'll need
to do to prepare. You'll likely want to determine import complexity to see how
much technical resources need to be allocated and you'll want to make
modifications to your import data to ensure that it imports properly. Below
are some guidelines to help you prepare your data for import into AtoM via
CSV.

.. IMPORTANT::

   We strongly recommend that imports never be carried out in your production
   environment, if possible. Instead, consider deploying a development/test
   version of your AtoM instance, performing the import(s) there, reviewing the
   data for any problems and making any required edits via the user interface,
   and then migrating this data to your production server. For more information,
   please see our section on :ref:`Server migration <server-migration>` in the
   Administrators manual.

.. _csv-determine-import-complexity:

Determining import complexity
-----------------------------

To quickly gauge the complexity of CSV data you wish to import, the
``csv:check-import`` command can be used in the command-line. This command
displays the following:

* The number of rows of data (useful when estimating the amount of processing
  time needed to perform the import, and whether or not you can use the
  :term:`user interface` to perform the import)
* The number of columns (useful when estimating the amount of developer time
  needed to map the columns to AtoM data - see: :ref:`csv-column-mapping`
  below)
* How many instances of pipe (|) characters are found in each column (pipe
  characters are used by some systems to put multiple values in a single cell
  of data)
* Sample column values

You will need access to the command-line of the server on which AtoM is
installed, and you will need to know the file path where your CSV is currently
located. Run the command from the root directory of your AtoM install.

**Example use:**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:check-import lib/task/import/example/rad/example_information_objects_rad.csv

.. _csv-column-mapping:

CSV Column mapping
------------------

AtoM was originally built to encourage broad adoption and use of the
`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__'s international standards, and expanded to support
other recognized standards. Consequently, all of
the description templates in AtoM correspond to a recognized content or
metadata exchange standard, and many of the fields in our underlying database
model are also inspired by ICA standards. For your data to import
successfully into AtoM, you will first need to map it to one of our existing
CSV templates, which are derived from the various standards-based templates
available in AtoM for description.

Mapping your data to the supplied CSV templates below implies a familiarity
with the standards used in AtoM, so you can make appropriate decisions on
which fields in your data map to which fields in AtoM, and how to proceed if
your data does not easily map 1:1 with the standard upon which our templates
are based.

**For further information and source links to the standards used in AtoM,
see:**

* :ref:`descriptive-standards`
* :ref:`data-entry`

The cell values in the top row of a CSV data file conventionally name each
column. The name indicates what kind of data the column contains. If the CSV
data you wish to import doesn't include a row like this, you should insert
one. You should then make the names correspond to AtoM-friendly names using
the top row of data in the example CSV file(s) appropriate to your import.

Available example files are:

* ISAD archival description CSV template
* RAD archival description CSV template
* Authority record CSV template

  * Authority record aliases CSV template
  * Authority record relationships CSV template

* Accessions CSV template
* Events CSV template

The order of the columns in the example CSV files is the same as the order in
the AtoM interface, and should be maintained. Having the correct names in the
cell values of the first row of your CSV data enables AtoM to import values in
each column to the correct AtoM fields.

.. TIP::

   A good way to make sure your column mapping is correct is to create a
   blank row after the top row and populate this with test values. You can
   then do an import, stop it after the first row (using CTRL-C), and make
   sure that all the values from the CSV row are present in AtoM. Including,
   in each field of a row, the letter corresponding to the corresponding
   spreadsheet column (including, for example, the text "(A)" for data in
   spreadsheet column A) makes it easy to quickly determine if a field is
   showing up on the AtoM side after import.

.. _csv-encoding-newline:

Verify character encoding and line endings
------------------------------------------

For your CSV files to import properly, you will need to ensure two things
prior to importing: that the
`character encoding <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding>`__ of
your CSV file is set to `UTF-8 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>`__, and
that the end-of-line characters used in your CSV conform to the Unix/Linux
style of newline character.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Your import will likely **fail** if you don't ensure these two things are
   are correctly set prior to import! Please review the sub-sections below
   for further details.

.. _csv-utf8-encoding:

Character encoding (UTF-8)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a CSV file to upload properly into AtoM (and display any special
characters such as accents contained in the data), your CSV file must use a
`UTF-8 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>`__ character encoding. If you have
used a Windows or Mac spreadsheet application (such as Excel, for example),
it's possible that the default character encoding will **not** be UTF-8. For
example, Excel uses  machine-specific ANSI encoding as its defaults during
install, so an EN-US installation might use Windows-1252 encoding by default,
rather than something more universal such as UTF-8 (the default encoding in
AtoM). This can cause problems on import into AtoM with special characters and
diacritics. Make sure that if you are using Excel or another spreadsheet
application, you are setting the character encoding to UTF-8. Many open source
spreadsheet programs, such as LibreOffice Calc, use UTF-8 by default, and
include an easy means for users to change the default encoding.

.. TIP::

   For Excel users, here is an eHow guide on converting CSV files to UTF-8:
   http://www.ehow.com/how_8387439_save-csv-utf8.html

.. _csv-line-endings:

Line endings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

"In computing, a newline, also known as a line ending, end of line (EOL), or
line break, is a special character or sequence of characters signifying the
end of a line of text. The actual codes representing a newline vary across
operating systems, which can be a problem when exchanging text files between
systems with different newline representations." (`Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline>`__)

Here are some of the differences:

* Unix / Linux / FreeBSD / OS X use LF (line feed, ``\n``, 0x0A)
* Macs prior to OS X use CR (carriage return, ``\r``, 0x0D)
* Windows / DOS use CR+LF (carriage return followed by line feed, ``\r\n``,
  0x0D0A)

AtoM's CSV import will expect Unix-style line breaks ( ``\n`` ). If you have
been using a spreadsheet application (such as Excel) on a Mac or Windows, you
may encounter import issues. There are many command-line utilities and free
software options out there to convert newline characters. Please ensure that
your spreadsheet is using the correct line endings prior to upload, otherwise
the upload will fail.

.. _csv-data-transformation:

Data transformation
-------------------

If you are working with a CSV export from another system (such a different
database), you may need to do further pre-processing to prepare your CSV. If
your previous system was designed for standards-compliance to a standard that
AtoM supports (see: :ref:`descriptive-standards`), the mapping process might
be simple - but if your system used custom data fields, mapping to one of the
supported standards could be trickier.

You may, for example, want to combine multiple CSV column values, that don't
cleanly map conceptually to AtoM-compatible CSV columns, into single columns
so they can be put into AtoM as notes. So *ColumnA* and *ColumnB* could be
combined into a *generalNote* column. This requires you to transform the data
before importing.

Depending on the size of your import data, this work can be done manually
using a spreadsheet program - simply cut and paste your data into the
corresponding cell in the provided import templates. However, for larger data
sets, data transformation can be done with custom programming (for example, a
Python script written by a :term:`developer`),  existing tools such as
the open source Pentaho
`Data Integration <http://community.pentaho.com/projects/data-integration/>`__
application, or by use of a CSV transformation script.

We have included some guidelines for creating custom CSV transformation
scripts. See:

* :ref:`csv-transformation`

.. NOTE::

   Creating custom CSV scripts is an activity generally performed by a
   :term:`developer`.

.. _csv-estimate-import-duration:

Estimating import duration
--------------------------

Once you've mapped the columns names in your CSV export to the corresponding
AtoM-compatible CSV column names you may wish to perform a test import.

A test import gives you an idea how long the import will take to complete on
your hardware. To estimate how long it will take to import 20,000 rows of CSV
data, for example, you could time the import of the first 1000 records and
multiply that by 20.

If your test import proves to be too slow on your hardware, or you don't have
hardware to spare, you can consider using cloud computing resources, such as
Open Hosting, Amazon EC2, or Rackspace Cloud.

.. _csv-testing-import:

Testing your import
-------------------

Once you've prepared your import, you may want to clone your AtoM site and
test your import on the clone before importing to your production AtoM
installation. This prevents you from having to delete any improperly imported
data. During import testing if you want to delete all imported data you can
use the command-line purge tool.

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`


.. _csv-legacy-id-mapping:

Legacy ID mapping: dealing with hierarchical data in a CSV
==========================================================

The *legacyId* column in imports is used to associate specific legacy data to
AtoM data using ID columns. Why would you need to associate this data? Let's
say you're importing a CSV file of description data you've exported from a
non-AtoM system. If the imported descriptions are in any way hierarchical --
with a fond containing items for example -- a column in a child description
will have to specify the legacy ID of its parent. The parent's legacy ID can
then be used to look up the AtoM ID of the parent that was imported earlier.
With the AtoM ID discovered, the parent/child relationship can then be
created. In addition to hierarchical description data, supplementary data such
as events must specify a legacy parent ID when imported.

.. figure:: images/keymap-table.*
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 20%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Image of the the keymap table in AtoM's database

   A representation of the keymap table in AtoM, from an Entity Relationship
   Diagram of AtoM's MySQL database.

When CSV data is imported into AtoM, values in the *legacyID* column are
stored in AtoM's keymap table, in a column named *source_id*. A system
administrator or :term:`developer` can access this information, either via
the command-line, or by using a graphical application such as
`phpMyAdmin <http://www.phpmyadmin.net>`__ to look up exising legacy ID values
in the *source_id* column of the MySQL keymap table.

In cases where data is being imported from multiple sources, legacy IDs may
conflict. Two datasets, for example, may have objects with an ID of 3. When
importing, you can use the command-line option ``--source-name`` to only record
or reference mappings for a specific data source. This will add a value in
the *source_name* column of AtoM's keymap table, which can then be used for
mapping subsequent imports.

The following example shows an import of information objects that records a
specific source name when mapping legacy IDs to AtoM IDs:

.. code-block:: bash

    php symfony csv:import information_objects_rad.csv --source-name=collection_name

In the above example, `collection_name` represents the value added by the user
during import - now `collection_name` will be added to the *source_name* column
of the keymap table for all records imported. Given the above example, the
subsequent import of :ref:`events <csv-import-events>` using the following
command would make sure that they get associated with information objects from
the specific source identified as `collection_name`:

.. code-block:: bash

  php symfony csv:event-import events.csv --source-name=collection_name

.. TIP::

   If you use the ``--source-name`` command-line option during your CSV
   import and you want to use spaces in the source name you add, you will
   need to enclose it in quotation marks. For example, both of the following
   are valid:

   `php symfony csv:import information_objects_rad.csv --source-name=collection_name`

   or:

   `php symfony csv:import information_objects_rad.csv --source-name="collection name"`

The ``--source-name`` option can also be used to keep larger imports that
have been broken into multiple CSV files related. Adding the ``--source-name``
option to each CSV import, with a common name added for each, will prevent
AtoM from duplicating import data, such as :term:`terms <term>` and actors
(:term:`authority records <authority record>`) during import.

.. _csv-import-descriptions:

Import archival descriptions via CSV
====================================

The information object import tool allows you to map CSV columns to AtoM data.
Example RAD and ISAD CSV template files are available in AtoM source code
(``lib/task/import/example/rad/example_information_objects_rad.csv`` and
``lib/task/import/example/isad/example_information_objects_isad.csv``) or you
can download the files here:

* RAD archival description CSV template [zip archive]
* ISAD(G) archival description CSV template [zip archive]

Hierarchical relationships
--------------------------

Information objects often have parent-child relationships - for example, a
series is a :term:`child <child record>` of the fonds to which it belongs; it
has a :term:`parent <parent record>` fonds. If you want to import a
:term:`fonds` or :term:`collection` into AtoM along with its lower levels of
description (i.e. its children - series, files, items, etc.), you will need a
way to specify which rows in your CSV file belong to which parent description.

There are two basic ways to specify which information object is the parent of
an information object being imported in your CSV - either through the use of
the *legacyID* and *parentID* columns (generally used for new descriptions being
imported, or from descriptions being migrated from another access system), or
by using the *qubitParentSlug* column to import new child descriptions to an
existing description in AtoM.

.. WARNING::

   Note that if you set both the *parentId* and *qubitParentSlug* in a single row,
   the import will default to using the *qubitParentSlug*. In general, only one
   type of parent specification should be used for each imported information
   object (i.e. each row in your CSV).

You **can** use a mix of *legacyId/parentId* and *qubitParentSlug* in the
same CSV, just not in the same row. So, for example, if you wanted to import
a series description as a child of a description already in AtoM, as well as
several files as children of the series description, you could set a *legacyID*
for the series, use the *qubitParentSlug* to point to the parent fonds or
collection already in AtoM, and then use the *parentID* column for all your
lower-level file descriptions. However, using both *parentID* and
*qubitParentSlug* in the same row will cause a conflict, and AtoM will prefer
the *qubitParentSlug* so the import does not fail.

Both methods of establishing hierarchical relationships are described below.

.. _csv-description-legacy-id:

LegacyID and parentID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One way  to establish hierarchical relationships during a CSV import involves
the use of the *parentId* column to specify a legacy ID (referencing the
*legacyId* column of a previously imported information object). This way is
most often used for migrations from other access systems. Using this method,
:term:`parent <parent record>` descriptions (e.g. :term:`fonds`,
:term:`collections <collection>`, etc) must appear **first** (i.e. above) in
your CSV and must include a legacyID - while  :term:`child records <child
record>` must appear **after** (i.e. below) their parent records in your CSV,
and must include the legacyID of the parent record in the *parentID* column.

Here is an example of the first three columns of a CSV file (shown in a
spreadsheet application), importing a **Fonds > Series > Item** hierarchy:

.. image:: images/csv-parentID-example.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: example CSV parentID rows


.. IMPORTANT::

   When the CSV is imported, it progresses row by row - meaning, if your CSV
   is not properly ordered with parent records appearing **before** their
   children, your import will fail!

.. _csv-description-parent-slug:

qubitParentSlug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other method of importing hierarchical data into AtoM enables you to
specify an existing :term:`archival description` that doesn't have a legacyID
(one, for example, that has been manually created using the AtoM web
interface), and import descriptions as children of the target description(s).

To specify a parent that exists in AtoM, you must first take note of the
parent information object's :term:`slug`. The "slug" is a textual identifier
that is included in the URL used to view the parent description. If the URL,
for example, is `http://myarchive.com/AtoM/index.php/example-fonds` then
the slug will be `example-fonds`. This slug value would then be included in
your import in the *qubitParentSlug* column in the rows of children of the
parent description.

Alternately, if you are using the command-line to perform your import, you can
use the ``--default-parent-slug`` option in the command-line to set a default
slug value, that will be used when no *qubitParentSlug* or *parentID* values
have been included for the row. For more information, see the details in the
:ref:`csv-cli-options` section below.

Here is an example of the first few columns of a CSV file (shown in a
spreadsheet application), importing a new series to an existing
:term:`fonds`, and importing two new file-level descriptions to an existing
series:

.. image:: images/csv-qubitParentSlug-example.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: example CSV qubitParentSlug rows

If desired, you can mix the use of the *qubitParentSlug* column with the use
of the *parentID* column in the same CSV - for example, you could attach a
new series to an existing fonds by giving it a *legacyID* and the slug for the
existing fonds in the *qubitParentSlug* column, and then including
lower-level files attached to the new series by adding the *legacyID* of the
new series to the *parentID* column of the new files.

.. IMPORTANT::

   You should not add both a *parentID* and a *qubitParentSlug* to the **same
   row** - AtoM expects one or the other. When the import encounters both
   columns populated in a single row, AtoM will default to use the
   *qubitParentSlug* value. In general, each row must have **only** one or the
   other - either a parent slug, or a parent ID.

Creator-related import columns
------------------------------

The *creators*, *creatorHistories*, *creatorDates*, *creatorDatesStart*, and
*creatorDatesEnd* columns are related to the creation of creators. If multiple
creators exist for an information object, the values in these fields should be
pipe-separated (e.g. using the | pipe separator between values).

.. image:: images/csv-creatorDates.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: example CSV creatorDates rows

Note that *creatorDates*, *creatorDatesStart*, and *creatorDatesEnd* fields
relate to **dates of creation** for the related description, and **not** to
the dates of existence for the related creators. The *creatorDates* field
will map to the free-text date field in AtoM, where users can use special
characters to express approximation, uncertainty, etc. (e.g. [190-?]; [ca.
1885]), while *creatorDatesStart* and *creatorDatesEnd* should include
ISO-formatted date values (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, or YYYY).

*creatorHistories* is equivalent to ISAD(G) 3.2.2, RAD 1.7B, and/or DACS 2.7 -
Administrative/Biographical history.

.. NOTE::

   Upon import, AtoM will create a new :term:`authority record` for any creator
   who does not already exist in AtoM, and will map the *creatorHistories* data
   for each creator to the "History" field in the related authority record. This
   information will be linked and visible in the related archival description.
   For more information on how AtoM handles authority records, see:

   * :ref:`authority-bioghist-access`
   * :ref:`term-name-vs-subject`

.. _csv-import-descriptions-digital-object:

Digital object-related import columns
-------------------------------------

As of AtoM 2.1, two new columns have been added to the
:ref:`ISAD <isad-template>` and :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` CSV import
templates: ``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI``. These columns will
allow you to link or upload a :term:`digital object` and attach it to the new
:term:`information object` being created in that row of the CSV.

In AtoM, a 1:1 relationship is maintained between information objects and
digital objects - meaning that for every :term:`archival description`, you can
only attach one :term:`digital object`. If you wish, you can create new
:term:`child records <child record>` - a number of item descriptions as
children of a file-level description; a number of part descriptions as
children of an item (for multiple views of a single object, for example, or
individual pages of a single book uploaded separately, etc), and so on.

In the CSV templates, the ``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI``
columns are positioned *after* the ``publicationStatus`` column, and *before*
the physical object-related import columns.

.. image:: images/csv-digital-object-columns-location.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: example CSV digitalObject rows

The ``digitalObjectPath`` column can be used to upload local digital objects -
simply provide a complete path and filename to the digital object.

The ``digitalObjectURI`` column can be used to link to externally hosted,
publicly available digital objects, such as those available at a specific URL
on the web. You must have a path directly to the digital object which includes
a file extension, and not just to a web page with a digital object located on
it somewhere - it is often the equivalent of right-clicking on a digital
object in your browser and selecting "View image".

You can use a mixture of the ``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI``
columns throughout your CSV (linking some information object rows to locally
uploaded digital objects, and others to web-based resources), but you cannot
use both columns in the same row. If AtoM encounters a CSV row where both the
``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI`` columns are populated, it will
favor the ``digitalObjectURI`` value, and ignore the ``digitalObjectPath``
value.

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`upload-digital-object`

Physical object-related import columns
--------------------------------------

The *physicalObjectName*, *physicalObjectLocation*, and *physicalObjectType*
columns are related to the creation of physical objects and physical storage
locations related to an :term:`archival description`.

.. image:: images/csv-physical-object.*
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: example CSV physicalObject rows

For more information on working with physical storage in AtoM, see:
:ref:`physical-storage`.

Standards related fields
-------------------------

Most fields in the CSV template have been named in a fairly obvious way,
translating a simplified version of the field name in our data entry
templates into a condensed `camelCase <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase>`__.
For example, the Rules for Archival description's General Material
Designation is rendered in the CSV header as *radGeneralMaterialDesignation*.
In both the RAD and ISAD templates, the Scope and Content field is marked by
the CSV header *scopeAndContent*. However, for users seeking a full mapping
of fields, consult the :ref:`RAD template <rad-template>` and
:ref:`ISAD template <isad-template>` pages for further details.

The *culture* column indicates to AtoM the default language of the descriptions
being uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code
values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian,
etc. See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
for a full list of ISO 639-1 language codes.

Other data entry notes
----------------------

* *language* and *languageOfDescription*, like *culture*, expect two-letter
  ISO 639-1 language code values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French,
  "it" for Italian, etc. See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
  for a full list of ISO 639-1 language codes. Unlike the *culture* column,
  however, these two fields will accept multiple values separated by a pipe
  character - for example, ``en|fr|it``.
* The *script* and *scriptOfDescription* columns expect four-letter ISO 15924
  script code values - for example, "Latn" for Latin-based scripts, "Cyrl"
  for Cyrillic scripts, etc. See `Unicode <www.unicode.org/iso15924/codelists.html>`__
  for a full list of ISO 15924 script codes.

.. IMPORTANT::

   We have discovered a bug in AtoM 2.0/2.1 related to some of the columns in
   our CSV import that map to terms managed in AtoM's taxonomies - including
   ``levelOfDetail``, ``radGeneralMaterialDesignation``, and
   ``descriptionStatus`` - if data for any of these columns is included in your CSV,
   values in these fields **must** conform to the default AtoM values for the
   import to succeed.

   We hope to fix this bug in a future release of AtoM, and have filed issue
   tickets to track work done to resolve these issues.

   * *levelOfDetail* - `#6756 <https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/6756>`__
   * *radGeneralMaterialDesignation* - `#6757 <https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/6757>`__
   * *descriptionStatus* -- `#6758 <https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/6758>`__

.. _csv-import-descriptions-gui:

Using the user interface
------------------------

For small imports (i.e. CSV files with less than 1,000 rows), imports can be
performed via the user interface.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the instructions
   above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Here is a basic checklist
   of things to check for importing a CSV of archival descriptions via the
   user interface:

   * CSV file is saved with UTF-8 encodings
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * CSV file is less than 1,000 rows
   * All :term:`parent <parent record>` descriptions appear in rows **above**
     their children
   * All new parent records have a *legacyID* value, and all
     :term:`children <child record>` include the parent's *legacyID* value in
     their *parentID* column
   * No row uses both *parentID* and *qubitParentSlug* (only one should be used
     - if both are present AtoM will default to using the *qubitParentSlug*)
   * Any records to be imported as children of an existing record in AtoM use
     the proper *qubitParentSlug* of the existing parent record

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
descriptions.

**To import a CSV file via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Archival description".

.. image:: images/csv-import-page.*

3. Click the "Browse" button to open a window on your local computer. Select
   the CSV file that you would like to import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

4. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-start.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: Starting a CSV import in AtoM

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, uploads performed via the user interface
   are limited by the browser's timeout limits - this is one of the reasons
   we recommend importing only smaller CSV files via the user interface.

5. After your import is complete, AtoM will list the amount of time the
   import took, and provide a link to the :term:`archival description` browse
   page. Unlike the XML import, a link directly to your import is not
   provided, because a CSV upload may contain multiple descriptions; instead,
   a link to the browse page is given, so users can locate their
   descriptions.

.. image:: images/csv-import-completed.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: Starting a CSV import in AtoM

.. TIP::

   Use the :ref:`sort button <recurring-sort-button>` located in the
   top-right hand side of the browse page to change the results display to be
   ordered by "Most recent" if it is not already - that way, the most
   recently added or edited descriptions will appear at the top of the
   results. If you have come directly here after importing your descriptions,
   they should appear at the top of the results.

   .. image:: images/csv-import-browse-page.*
      :align: center
      :width: 85%
      :alt: The browse page following a CSV import

6. If any warnings or errors are encountered, AtoM will also display them on
   the import page. Some warnings will cause an import to fail (and some will
   not - they will alert the user, but the import will still complete), while
   all error messages mean that the import has failed, and a link to the
   :term:`archival description` browse page will not be provided. - instead,
   the CSV upload page will reappear below the error message. Errors can
   occur for many reasons - please review the checklist
   :ref:`above <csv-import-descriptions-gui>` for suggestions on resolving
   the most common reasons that CSV imports fail.

.. _csv-import-descriptions-cli:

Using the command-line interface (CLI)
--------------------------------------

For larger CSV imports (e.g. those with 1,000 or more rows), we recommend
using the Command-line interface to import your descriptions.

Example use (with the RAD CSV template) - run from AtoM's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:import lib/task/import/example/rad/example_information_objects_rad.csv

.. _csv-cli-options:

Command-line options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/cliopts.*
  :align: center
  :width: 85%
  :alt: An image of the command-line options for CSV import

By typing ``php symfony help csv:import`` into the command-line from your root
directory, without specifying the location of a CSV, you will able able to
see the CSV import options available (pictured above). A brief explanation of
each is included below.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--rows-until-update`` option can be used for a simple visual
representation of progress in the command-line. Enter a whole integer, to
represent the number of rows should be imported from the CSV before the
command-line prints a period (e.g. `` . `` ) in the console, as a sort of
crude progress bar. For example, entering ``--rows-until-update=5`` would
mean that the import progresses, another period will be printed every 5 rows.
This is a simple way to allow the command-line to provide a visual output of
progress. For further information on the ``--rows-until-update`` option and an
example of the command-line option in use, see also the section below,
:ref:`csv-import-progress`.

You can use the ``--skip-rows`` option to skip **X** amount of rows in the CSV
before beginning the import. This can be useful if you have interrupted the
import, and wish to re-run it without duplicating the records already
imported. ``--skip-rows=10`` would skip the first 10 rows in the CSV file,
for example. Note that this count does **not** inlcude the header column, so
in fact, the above example would skip the header column, and rows 2-11 in
your CSV file.

The ``--error-log`` option can be used to specify a directory where errors
should be logged. **Note that this option has not been tested by Artefactual
developers**.

Use the ``--source-name`` option (described :ref:`above <csv-legacy-id-mapping>`
to specify a source when importing information objects from multiple sources
(with possibly conflicting legacy IDs). This will ensure that multiple related
CSV files will remain related - so, for example, if you import an
:term:`archival description` CSV, and then supplement the
:term:`authority records <authority record>` created (from the *creators* field
in the description CSV templates) with an authority record CSV import, using the
``--source-name`` option will make sure that matching names are linked and
related, instead of duplicate authority records being created. You can also
use this option to relate a large import that is broken up into multiple
CSV files. See the :ref:`csv-legacy-id-mapping` section above for further
tips and details on the uses of this option.

The ``--default-legacy-parent-id`` option will allow the user to set a default
*parentID* value - for any row in the CSV where no *parentID* value is
included and no *qubitParentSlug* is present, this default value will be
inserted as the *parentID*.

Similarly, the ``--default-parent-slug`` option allows a user to set a
default *qubitParentSlug* value - wherever no slug value or *parentID* /
*legacyID*  is included, AtoM will populate the *qubitParentSlug* with the
default value. If you are importing **all** rows in a CSV file to one parent
description already in AtoM, you could use the ``--default-parent-slug`` option
to specify the target :term:`slug` of the parent, and then leave the *legacyID*,
*parentID*, and *qubitParentSlug* columns blank in your CSV. **Note** that this
example will affect ALL rows in a CSV - so use this **only** if you are
importing all descriptions to a single parent!

By default, AtoM will build the
`nested set <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model>`__ after an import
task. The nested set is a way to manage hierarchical data stored in the flat
tables of a relational database. However, as Wikipedia notes, "Nested sets are
very slow for inserts because it requires updating left and right domain values
for all records in the table after the insert. This can cause a lot of database
thrash as many rows are rewritten and indexes rebuilt." When performing a large
import, it can therefore sometimes be desirable to disable the building of the
nested set during the import process, and then run it as a separate command-line
task following the completion of the import. To achieve this, the
``--skip-nested-set-build`` option can be used to disable the default behavior.

**NOTE** that the nested set WILL need to be built for AtoM to behave as
expected. You can use the following command-line task, from the AtoM root
directory, to rebuild the nested set if you have disabled during import:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony propel:build-nested-set

.. TIP::

   Want to learn more about why and how nested sets are used? Here are a few
   great resources:

   * Mike Hyllier's article on
     `Managing Hierarchical data in MySQL <http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/>`__
   * Evan Petersen's discussion of `nested sets <http://www.evanpetersen.com/item/nested-sets.html>`__
   * Wikipedia's `Nested set model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model>`__

Similarly, when using the :ref:`user interface <csv-import-descriptions-gui>`
to perform an import, the import is indexed automatically - but when running
an import via the command-line interface, indexing is disabled by default.
This is because indexing during import can be incredibly slow, and the
command-line is generally used for larger imports. Generally, we recommend a
user simply clear the cache and rebuild the search index following an import -
from AtoM's root directory, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony cc && php symfony search:populate

However, if a user would like to index the import as it progresses, the
``--index`` option can be used to enable this.

.. _csv-import-events:

Import events via CSV
=====================

The information object (e.g., :term:`archival description`) import tool allows
you to import creation events, but doesn't accommodate other types of events,
such as accumulation, broadcasting, etc).

For this the event import tool is better suited and should be ran after you
import your information objects.

The event import processes 3 CSV columns: *legacyId*, *eventActorName*, and
*eventType*. The *legacyId* should be the legacy ID of the information object the
event will be associated with. The *eventActorName* and *eventType* specify the
name of the actor involved in the event and the type of event. An example CSV
template file is available in the AtoM source code
(``lib/task/import/example_events.csv``) or can be downloaded here:

* (link forthcoming - see the
  `qubit-toolkit wiki <https://www.qubit-toolkit.org/wiki/CSV_import#Importing_events>`__
  for now)

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the instructions
   above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Here is a basic checklist
   of things to check for importing a CSV of events via the user interface:

   * CSV file is saved with UTF-8 encodings
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * CSV file is less than 1,000 rows if importing via the :term:`user interface`
   * All *legacyID* values entered correspond to the *legacyID* values of
     their corresponding archival descriptions
   * If you are referencing existing
     :term:`authority records <authority record>` already in AtoM, make sure
     that the name used in the *actorName* column matches the authorized form
     of name in the authority record exactly.

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
events.

.. _csv-import-events-gui:

Using the user interface
------------------------

For small imports (i.e. CSV files with less than 1,000 rows), imports can be
performed via the user interface.

**To import an events CSV file via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center

   the events CSV file that you would like to import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%

   are limited by the browser's timeout limits - this is one of the reasons
   we recommend importing only smaller CSV files via the user interface.

.. _csv-import-events-cli:

Using the command-line interface (CLI)
--------------------------------------

For larger CSV imports (e.g. those with 1,000 or more rows), we recommend
using the Command-line interface to import your descriptions.

Example use - run from AtoM's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:event-import lib/task/import/example/example_events.csv

There are also various command-line options that can be used, as illustrated in
the options depicted in the image below:

.. image:: images/csv-event-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the command-line options for events imports

By typing ``php symfony help csv:event-import`` into the command-line from your
root directory, without specifying the location of a CSV, you will able able to
see the CSV import options available (pictured above). A brief explanation of
each is included below.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--rows-until-update``, ``--skip-rows``, and ``--error-log`` options can
be used the same was as described in the section :ref:`above <csv-cli-options>`
on importing descriptions. For more information on the ``--rows-until-update``
option, see also the section below, :ref:`csv-import-progress`.

Use the ``--source-name`` to specify a source importing to a AtoM installation
in which information objects from multiple sources have been imported, and/or
to associate it explicitly with a previously-imported CSV file that used the
same ``--source-name`` value. An example is provided
:ref:`above <csv-legacy-id-mapping>` in the section on legacy ID mapping.

The ``--event-types`` option is deprecated, and no longer supported in AtoM.

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _csv-import-repositories:

Import archival institutions via CSV
====================================

You can import repositories (i.e. :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`
into AtoM as well. At this time, there is no support for importing a
repository CSV via the :term:`user interface` - however, the command-line
may be used.

CSV columns
-----------

* The *uploadLimit* column allows a user to set a default upload limit for a
  repository at the time of import. This value should be a number,
  representing Gigabytes. For more information on the use of respository
  upload limits in AtoM, see: :ref:`upload-limit`.
* Almost all other fields are drawn directly from the archival institution
  edit template in AtoM, which is based upon the International Council on
  Archives' International Standard for Describing Institutions with Archival
  Holdings (`ISDIAH <http://www.ica.org/10198/standards/isdiah-international-standard-for-describing-institutions-with-archival-holdings.html>`__).
  For more information on the use of each field, see: :ref:`isdiah-template`.

  * Most fields in the CSV template have been named in a fairly obvious way,
    translating a simplified version of the field name in our data entry
    templates into a condensed `camelCase <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase>`__.
    For example, ISDIAH 5.3.2, Geographical and cultural context (in the
    Description :term:`Area <information area>`) becomes *geoCulturalContext*
    in the CSV template. Consult the :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` for further
    help with fields.

* The *culture* column indicates to AtoM the language of the descriptions
  being uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code
  values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian,
  etc. See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
  for a full list of ISO 639-1 language codes.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"
   instructions above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Most
   importantly, make sure your:

   * CSV file is saved with UTF-8 encodings
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)

Using the command-line
----------------------

Example use - run from AtoM's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:repository-import lib/task/import/example/example_repositories.csv

There are also various command-line options that can be used, as illustrated in
the options depicted in the image below:

.. image:: images/csv-repo-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the command-line options for repository imports

By typing ``php symfony help csv:repository-import`` into the command-line from
your root directory, without specifying the location of a CSV, you will able
able to see the CSV import options available (pictured above). A brief
explanation of each is included below.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--rows-until-update``, ``--skip-rows``, and ``--error-log`` options can
be used the same was as described in the section :ref:`above <csv-cli-options>`
on importing descriptions. For more information on the ``--rows-until-update``
option, see also the section below, :ref:`csv-import-progress`.

The ``--merge-existing`` option may be used to avoid the creation of
duplicate repositories. That is - if, during import, any rows in the CSV
contain the same authorized form of name as a repository already in the
database, those rows will be ignored (i.e. not imported).

You can use the ``--upload-limit`` option to specify the default upload limit for
repositories which don't specify their *uploadLimit* in the CSV file. That is,
if for example you performed a CSV import with the command-line option of
``--upload-limit=5``, then for every repository in the CSV that does NOT have
a value in the *uploadLimit* column, the default value of 5 GBs will be
assigned.

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _csv-import-authority-records:

Import authority records via CSV
================================

The authority record import tool allows you to import data about organizations
and individuals. In addition to importing data detailing these entities, the
tool also allows the simultaneous import of supplementary data (in separate CSV
files) on how these entities relate to each other and alternate names these
entities are known by.

You can view the example CSV files for authority records via our Github
repository, `here <https://github.com/artefactual/atom/tree/2.x/lib/task/import/example/authority_records>`__.
Examples can also be found in the AtoM code (at
``lib/task/import/example/authority_records/``) or can be downloaded directly
here:

* (Links forthcoming - see the
  `qubit-toolkit wiki <https://www.qubit-toolkit.org/wiki/CSV_import#Column_mapping>`__
  for now)

CSV Columns
-----------

A brief explanation of the main fields in each CSV template is included
below.

Authority records CSV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The *culture* column indicates to AtoM the language of the descriptions
  being uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code
  values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian,
  etc. See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
  for a full list of ISO 639-1 language codes.
* the *typeOfEntity* column maps to the entity type terms recommended in
  ISAAR 5.1.1 Type of Entity, and maintained in AtoM in the *Actor Entity
  Types* :term:`taxonomy`. This column expects one of three recommended
  values - Person, Corporate body, or Family.
* Almost all other fields are drawn directly from the :term:`authority record`
  edit template in AtoM, which is based upon the International Council on
  Archives' International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate
  Bodies, Persons and Famillies (`ISAAR-CPF <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd-edition.html>`__).
  For more information on the use of each field, see: :ref:`isaar-template`.

  * Most fields in the CSV template have been named in a fairly obvious way,
    translating a simplified version of the field name in our data entry
    templates into a condensed `camelCase <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase>`__.
    For example, ISAAR 5.2.1, Dates of Existence (in the ISAAR
    Description :term:`Area <information area>`) becomes
    *datesOfExistence* in the CSV template. Consult the
    :ref:`ISDIAH <isaar-template>` for further help with fields.
  * The *history* column, which conforms to ISAAR 5.2.2, will appear as the
    Administrative or Biographical history in any  :term:`archival description`
    that the :term:`authority record` is linked to. For more information on how
    AtoM manages authority records, see: :ref:`authority-records`.

.. _csv-authority-alternate-names:

Alternate names CSV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The *parentAuthorizedFormOfName* should match exactly a target name in the
  related authority record CSV being imported. The aliases (or alternate
  names) included in the Aliases CSV will be associated with that actor's
  :term:`authority record` following import.
* The *alternateForm* should include the alternate name or alias you wish to import.
* The *formType* column contains data about what kind of alternate is being
  created. Each alias can be one of three forms: a parallel form, a standardized
  form according to other descriptive practices, or an "other" form. Enter
  either "parallel", "standardized", or "other" as a value in this the cells
  of this column. For more information on the distinction between these three
  types of alternate names, please consult
  `ISAAR-CPF <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd-edition.html>`__
  5.1.3 - 5.1.5
* The *culture* column indicates to AtoM the language of the descriptions
  being uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code
  values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian,
  etc. See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
  for a full list of ISO 639-1 language codes.

.. _csv-authority-relationships:

Relationships CSV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The *sourceAuthorizedFormOfName* is used to specify one of the actors
  included in the Authority record CSV upload. This field should match
  exactly one of the actors listed in the *authorizedFormOfName* column of
  the Authority record CSV.
* The *targetAuthorizedFormOfName* is also used to specify one of the actors
  in the Authority record CSV upload - the actor with which you intend to
  create a relationship. The values entered int this column should match
  exactly one of the actors listed in the *authorizedFormOfName* column of
  the Authority record CSV.
* The *category* column contains data about the type of relationship you are
  creating, and maps to ISAAR 5.3.2 Category of Relationship. The terms
  recommended in the ISAAR standard are maintained in the Actor Relation Type
  :term:`taxonomy` in AtoM. Values entered should be either "associative",
  "family", "hierarchical", or "temporal". For more information on the
  distinction between these terms, please consult
  `ISAAR-CPF <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd-edition.html>`__
  5.3.2.
* The *date* field is a free-text string field that will allow a user to enter
  a date or date range for the relationship. It allows the use of special
  characters and typographical marks to indicate approximation (e.g. [ca.
  1900]) and/or uncertainty (e.g. [199-?]). Use the *startDate* and *endDate*
  fields to enter ISO-formated date values (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, or
  YYYY) that correspond to the free-text *date* field. Public users in the
  interface will see the *date* field values when viewing relationships; the
  *startDate* and *endDate* values are not visible, and are used for date
  range searching in the application.
* The *culture* column indicates to AtoM the language of the descriptions
  being uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code
  values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian,
  etc. See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__
  for a full list of ISO 639-1 language codes.

--------------------------------------

Example use - run from AtoM's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:authority-import lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_records.csv

There are also various command-line options that can be used, as illustrated in
the options depicted in the image below:

.. image:: images/csv-authority-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the command-line options for authority record imports

By typing ``php symfony help csv:authority-import`` into the command-line from
your root directory, **without** specifying the location of a CSV, you will
able able to see the CSV import options available (pictured above). A brief
explanation of each is included below.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--rows-until-update``, ``--skip-rows``, ``--error-log``, and ``--index``
options can be used the same was as described in the section
:ref:`above <csv-cli-options>` on importing descriptions. For more information
on the ``--rows-until-update`` option, see also the section below,
:ref:`csv-import-progress`.

The ``--alias-file`` and ``--relation-file`` options are used to import
accompanying alternate name (aka Alias data) and relationship CSV files at
the same time as the authority record CSV import. An example of each will be
given below, though they can be used together.

.. _csv-import-aliases-cli:

Importing alternate names (Alias data)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternate names are defined in a separate CSV file. Each alias can be one of
three forms: a parallel form, a standardized form, or "other" form. See the
section on data entry :ref:`above <csv-authority-alternate-names>` for further
guidance.

An example CSV template file of supplementary alias data is available in the
AtoM source code ( at ``lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_
record_aliases.csv``) or can be downloaded here:

* (link forthcoming - see the
  `qubit-toolkit wiki <https://www.qubit-toolkit.org/wiki/CSV_import#Alias_data>`__
  for now)

The Alternate names CSV file must be imported at the same time as its related
Authority record CSV file. The ``--alias-file`` command-line option is used
to specify a separate path to the Alternate names CSV, with a back slash
( ``\`` ) used to separate it from the path of the original authority record
CSV, as shown below.

**Example import of authority records and corresponding aliases:**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:authority-import lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_records.csv \
   --alias-file=lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_record_aliases.csv


.. _csv-import-relations-cli:

Importing related corporate bodies, persons, or families
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Relations between authority records are also defined in a separate CSV file.
Each relationship can be either hierarchical, temporal, family, or
associative. See the section on data entry
:ref:`above <csv-authority-relationships>` for further guidance.

An example CSV template file of relation data is available in the AtoM source
code ( at ``lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_record_relat
ionships.csv``) or can be downloaded here:

* (link forthcoming - see the
  `qubit-toolkit wiki <https://www.qubit-toolkit.org/wiki/CSV_import#Related_corporate_bodies.2C_persons_or_families>`__
  for now)

The Relationships CSV file must be imported at the same time as its related
Authority record CSV file. The ``--relation-file`` command-line option is used
to specify a separate path to the Relationships names CSV, with a back slash
( ``\`` ) used to separate it from the path of the original authority record
CSV, as shown below.

**Example import of authority records and corresponding relationships:**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:authority-import lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_records.csv \
   --relation-file=lib/task/import/example/authority_records/example_authority_record_relationships.csv

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _csv-import-accessions:

Import accessions via CSV
=========================

When importing information objects (e.g.
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, you can specify an
associated :term:`accession record` using an ``accessionNumber`` column in the
CSV. After importing your information objects you can then run the accession
import tool to import details about each accession from a CSV file.

An example CSV template file is available in the
``lib/task/import/example/example_accessions.csv`` directory of AtoM, or it
can be downloaded here:

* (link forthcoming - see the
  `qubit-toolkit wiki <https://www.qubit-toolkit.org/wiki/CSV_import#Importing_accessions>`__
  for now)

As of AtoM 2.1, a new column, ``qubitParentSlug`` has been added. This column
will behave similarly to the ``qubitParentSlug`` column in the
:term:`archival description` CSV templates (described
:ref:`above <csv-description-parent-slug>`) - it will allow you to link new
CSV-imported accessions to existing descriptions in AtoM. To link an accession
row in your CSV to an existing description in your AtoM instance, simply enter
the :term:`slug` of the target description in the ``qubitParentSlug`` column.
AtoM will located the matching description, and link the two during import,
similar to how an accession created through the user interface can be linked
to a description (see: :ref:`link-accession-description`).

.. _csv-import-accessions-gui:

Using the user interface
------------------------

For small imports (i.e. CSV files with less than 1,000 rows), accession record
imports can be performed via the user interface.

**To import an accessions CSV file via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: The import menu

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Accession".

.. image:: images/import-accession-gui.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM

3. Click the "Browse" button to open a window on your local computer. Select
   the :term:`authority record` CSV file that you would like to import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

4. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. image:: images/import-accession-2.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: Starting a CSV import in AtoM

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, uploads performed via the user interface
   are limited by the browser's timeout limits - this is one of the reasons
   we recommend importing only smaller CSV files via the user interface.


.. _csv-import-accessions-cli:

Using the command-line interface (CLI)
--------------------------------------

For larger :term:`accession record` imports (e.g. those with 1,000 or more
rows), we recommend using the command-line task to import your CSV file.

**Example use** - run from AtoM's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:accession-import /path/to/my/example_accessions.csv

There are also a number of options available with this command-line task.

.. image:: images/csv-accession-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the command-line options for accession record imports

By typing ``php symfony help csv:accession-import`` into the command-line from
your root directory, **without** specifying the location of a CSV, you will
able able to see the CSV import options available (pictured above). A brief
explanation of each is included below.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

Use the ``--source-name`` to specify a source importing to a AtoM installation
in which accessions and information objects from multiple sources have been
imported, and/or to associate it explicitly with a previously-imported CSV
file that used the same ``--source-name`` value. An example is provided
:ref:`above <csv-legacy-id-mapping>` in the section on legacy ID mapping.

The ``--rows-until-update``, ``--skip-rows``, ``--error-log``, and ``--index``
options can be used the same was as described in the section
:ref:`above <csv-cli-options>` on importing descriptions. For more information
on the ``--rows-until-update`` option, see also the section below,
:ref:`csv-import-progress`.


:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _csv-import-progress:

Display the progress of an upload via the command-line interface (CLI)
======================================================================

The various CSV import tools allow the use of the ``--rows-until-update``
command-line option to display the current row of CSV data being imported.
This is an extremely simplified way to indicate progress graphically via the
command-line - the user sets a numerical value for the number of rows the task
will progress before an update, and then the task will output a dot (or period
) in the command-line every time the indicated number of rows has been
processed in the current CSV.

Example use reporting progress every 5 rows:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony csv:import lib/task/import/example/rad/example_information_objects_rad.csv --rows-until-update=5

This can be useful for large imports, to ensure the import is still progressing,
and to try to roughly determine how far the task has progressed and how long
it will take to complete.

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _digital-object-load-task:

Load digital objects via the command line
=========================================

Known as the **Digital object load task**, this command-line tool will allow a
user to bulk attach digital objects to existing information objects (e.g.
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`) through the use of a
simple CSV file.

This task will take a CSV file as input, which contains two columns: ``filename``
and **EITHER** ``information_object_id`` **OR** ``identifier`` as the second
column; the script will fail if these column headers are not
present in the first row of the CSV file, and it will fail if there are more
than 2 columns - you must choose which variable you prefer to work with (
identifier or object ID) for the second column. Each will be explained below.

The ``filename`` column contains the full (current) path to the digital asset
(file). The ``information_object_id`` or ``identifier`` column identifies the
linked information object. AtoM does not allow more than one digital object
per information object (with the exception of derivatives), and each digital
object must have a corresponding information object to describe it, so this
one-to-one relationship must be respected in the CSV import file.

The ``information_object_id`` is a unique internal value assigned to each
:term:`information object` in AtoM's database - it is not visible via the
:term:`user interface` and you will have to perform a SQL query to find it out
- a sample SQL query with basic instructions has been included below.

The ``identifier`` can be used instead if preferred. A
:term:`description's <archival description>` identifier is visible in the
:term:`user interface`, which can make it less difficult to discover. **
However,**, if the target description's identifier is not unique throughout
your AtoM instance, the digital object may not be attached to the correct
description - AtoM will attach it to the first matching identifier it finds.

.. _digital-object-load-sql-object-id:

Finding the information_object_id
---------------------------------

The ``information_object_id`` is not a value that is accessible via the
:term:`user interface` - it is a unique value used in AtoM's database. You can,
however, use SQL in the command-line to determine the ID of an information
object. The following example will show you how to use a SQL query to find the
``information_object_id``, if you know the :term:`slug` of the description:

1. First, you will need to access mysqlCLI to be able to input a SQL query. To
   do this, you will need to know the database name, user name, and password you
   used when creating your database during installation. If your database is
   on a different server (e.g. if you are trying to SSH in to access your
   database server), you will also need to know the hostname - that is, the IP
   address or domain name of the server where your database is located.
2. The following is an example of the CLI command to enter to access mysqlCLI:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mysql -u root -pMYSECRETPASSWORD atom

   * ``-u`` = user. If you followed our :ref:`installation instructions
     <installation-linux>`, this will be ``root``
   * ``-p`` = password. Enter the password you used during installation right
     after the ``-p``. If you did not enter a password, include the ``-p``
     on its own. If you are prompted later for a password and didn't use one,
     just press enter.
   * ``-h`` = hostname. If your database is on a different server, supply either
     an IP address, or the domain name, where it is located.
   * ``atom`` = your database name. If you followed our
     :ref:`installation instructions <installation-linux>`, this will be
     ``atom``; otherwise enter the database name you used when installing AtoM.

3. You may be prompted for your password again. If so, enter it. If you did
   not use a password during installation, simply press enter.
4. Your command prompt should now say something like ``mysql>``. You can now
   enter a SQL query directly.
5. The following example SQL command will return the information_object_id for
   a desription, when the information object's :term:`slug` is known:

   .. code-block:: bash

      SELECT object_id FROM slug WHERE slug='your-slug-here';

6. The query should return the object_id for the description. Here is an
   example:

.. image:: images/digi-object-load-mysql-select.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of a successful SELECT statement in mysqlCLI

7. Enter ``quit`` to exit mysqlCLI.

Using the digital object load task
----------------------------------

Before using this task, you will need to prepare:

* A CSV file with 2 columns -  **EITHER** ``information_object_id`` and
  ``filename``, **OR** ``identifier`` and ``filename``
* A directory with your digital objects inside of it

.. IMPORTANT::

   You cannot use both ``information_object_id`` and ``identifier`` in the
   same CSV - it must be one or the other. If you use the ``identifier``, make
   sure your target description identifiers are **unique** in AtoM - otherwise
   your digital objects may not upload to the right description!

Here is a sample image of what the CSV looks like when the identifier is used,
and the CSV is prepared in a spreadsheet application:

.. image:: images/digital-object-load-identifier.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Example CSV for digitalobject:load task using identifier

.. TIP::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the instructions
   :ref:`above <csv-encoding-newline>`, to ensure that your CSV will work when
   used with the ``digitalobject:load`` task. The key point when creating a
   CSV is to ensure the following:

   * CSV file is saved with UTF-8 encodings
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)

You can see the options available on the CLI task by typing in the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony help digitalobject:load


.. image:: images/digital-object-load-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the command-line options for digitalobject:load

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

By default, the digital object load task will **not index** the collection as
it runs. This means that normally, you will need to manually repopulate the
search index after running the task. Running without indexing allows the task
to complete much more quickly - however, if you're only uploading a small set
of digital objects, you can choose to have the task index the collection as it
progresses, using the ``--index`` (or ``-i``) option

The ``--path`` option will allow you to simplify the ``filename`` column in
your CSV, to avoid repetition. If all the digital objects you intend to upload
are stored in the same folder, then adding /path/to/my/folder/ to each object
filename seems tedious - your ``filename`` column will need to look something
like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   filename
   /path/to/my/folder/image1.png
   /path/to/my/folder/image2.jpg
   /path/to/my/folder/text1.pdf
   etc...

To avoid this when all digital objects are in the same directory, you can use
the ``--path`` option to pre-supply the path to the digital objects - for each
filename, the path supplied will be appended. **Note** that you will need to
use a trailing slash to finish your path prefix - e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:load --path="/path/to/my/folder/" /path/to/my/spreadsheet.csv


**TO RUN THE DIGITAL OBJECT LOAD TASK**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:load /path/to/your/loadfile.csv

**NOTES ON USE**

* If an information object already has a :term:`digital object` attached to it,
  it will be skipped during the import
* Remember to repopulate the search index afterwards if you haven't used the
  ``--index`` option!


  .. code-block:: bash

     php symfony search:populate


Regenerating derivatives
------------------------

Sometimes the ``digitalobject:load`` task won't generate the :term:`thumbnail`
and :term:`reference <reference display copy>` images properly for digital
objects that were loaded (e.g. due to a crash or absence of convert installed,
etc.). In this case, you can regenerate these thumbsnail/reference images using
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives

.. WARNING::

   All of your current derivatives will be deleted! They will be replaced
   with new derivatives after the task has finished running. If you have
   manually changed the :term:`thumbnail` or :term:`reference display copy`
   of a digital object via the user interface (see:
   :ref:`edit-digital-object`), these two will be replaced with digital
   object derivatives created from the :term:`master digital object`.

For more information on this task and the options available, see:
:ref:`cli-regenerate-derivatives`.

.. _csv-search-indexing:

Index your content after an upload
==================================

After an import, you'll want to index your content so it can be searched by
users. To do so, enter the following into the command-line:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony search:populate

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`
