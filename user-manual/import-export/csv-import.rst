Most often understood as an acronym for "comma-separated values" (though
sometimes called "character-separated values" because the separator character
does not have to be a comma), `CSV`_ is a file format that stores tabular data
in plain-text form. Information with common properties that can be expressed
as a sequence of fields sharing a common header can be stored in plain-text
using the CSV format, making it application agnostic and highly transportable.

A CSV file consists of a number of records (rows), that have identical fields,
separated by commas (or in some cases, another separator). Often a header
column (i.e. the cell values in first or top row of a CSV file) is included,
naming each column and indicating what kind of data the column contains. Data
is then entered using a separator or delimiter (such as a comma) to indicate a
separation of fields (or cells), and a line break or carriage return to
indicate rows (i.e. different records). Most spreadsheet applications (such as
LibreOffice Calc or MS Excel) can open CSV files and express them as a
spreadsheet. See Wikipedia for more information on `CSV`_.

**In AtoM**, the CSV import function allows user to import data from a
spreadsheet, or another database (so long as the export from the database is
made to conform with the AtoM CSV template format). Artefactual has created a
number of :ref:`CSV templates <csv-column-mapping>` that can be used to import
various different :term:`entity` types. AtoM expects the column headers used in
the templates and imports that do not conform to this pattern will fail or
cause unexpected results.

CSV imports performed via the :term:`user interface` in AtoM are are executed
as :term:`jobs <job>` and performed asynchronously in the background to avoid
timeouts in the web browser. Jobs in AtoM are handled by `Gearman`_, and the 
status of AtoM jobs can be seen in the :term:`user interface` via the 
**Manage > Jobs** page. For more information, see: :ref:`manage-jobs` and 
:ref:`maintenance-asynchronous-jobs`.

To import CSV files, a user must be logged in as an :term:`administrator`.
For more information on user groups and permissions, see:

* :ref:`user-roles`
* :ref:`manage-user-accounts`
* :ref:`edit-user-permissions`

In addition to importing new records, AtoM can also attempt to identify
matches on existing records and either update them in place, or delete the
matches before importing the new records as replacements. This functionality
will be described in greater detail below, along with other import options.

.. _csv-before-you-import:

Before you import
=================

Before you start importing records, there are a number of things you'll need
to do to prepare. You'll likely want to determine import complexity to see how
much technical resources need to be allocated and you'll want to make
modifications to your import data to ensure that it imports properly. Below
are some guidelines to help you prepare your data for import into AtoM via
CSV.

.. IMPORTANT::

   We strongly recommend that imports never be carried out in your production
   environment, if possible. Instead, consider deploying a development/test
   version of your AtoM instance, performing the import(s) there, reviewing the
   data for any problems and making any required edits via the user interface,
   and then migrating this data to your production server. For more information 
   on how to migrate data, see: 

   * :ref:`installation-upgrading`
   * :ref:`maintenance-data-backup`

**Jump to**

* :ref:`csv-column-mapping`

* :ref:`csv-estimate-import-duration`

.. _csv-column-mapping:

CSV Column mapping
------------------

AtoM was originally built to encourage broad adoption and use of the `ICA`_'s
international standards, and expanded to support other recognized standards.
Consequently, all of the description templates in AtoM correspond to a
recognized content or metadata exchange standard, and many of the fields in
our underlying database model are also inspired by ICA standards. For your
data to import successfully into AtoM, you will first need to map it to one of
our existing CSV templates, which are derived from the various standards-based
templates available in AtoM for description.

Mapping your data to the supplied CSV templates below implies a familiarity
with the standards used in AtoM, so you can make appropriate decisions on
which fields in your data map to which fields in AtoM, and how to proceed if
your data does not easily map 1:1 with the standard upon which our templates
are based.

**For further information and source links to the standards used in AtoM,
see:**

* :ref:`descriptive-standards`
* :ref:`data-entry`

The cell values in the top row of a CSV data file conventionally name each
column. The name indicates what kind of data the column contains. If the CSV
data you wish to import doesn't include a row like this, you should insert
one. You should then make the names correspond to AtoM-friendly names using
the top row of data in the example CSV file(s) appropriate to your import.

Available example files are:

* ISAD archival description CSV template
* RAD archival description CSV template
* Authority record CSV template
* Authority record relationships CSV template
* Accessions CSV template
* Deaccessions CSV template
* Events CSV template
* Repository CSV template
* Physical storage locations CSV template

All CSV templates can be found on the AtoM wiki:

* `CSV import templates`_

You can also find all example CSV import templates included in your AtoM
installation, in: ``lib/task/import/example``.

The order of the columns in the example CSV files is the same as the order in
the AtoM interface, and should be maintained. Having the correct names in the
cell values of the first row of your CSV data enables AtoM to import values in
each column to the correct AtoM fields.

.. TIP::

   If you would like to better understand how AtoM's import columns map to 
   supported data entry fields in your chosen template, try importing one of 
   `CSV import templates`_ found on the AtoM wiki. Each field in these 
   templates is populated with example data that includes the name of the 
   related standards-based field - for example, the example data in the 
   :ref:`ISAD(G) <isad-template>` import template for the ``scopeAndContent`` 
   field is "Example fonds Scope and content (ISAD 3.3.1)". Comparing the 
   example data in your import template with the resulting record in AtoM 
   should help you better understand how the column names map to AtoM's 
   standard-based data entry fields. 

   Another good way to make sure your column mapping is correct while using 
   your own metadata is to create a blank row after the top row and populate 
   this with test values. You can then do an import, stop it after the first 
   row (using ``CTRL+C`` if importing from the command-line), and make sure 
   that all the values from the CSV row are present in AtoM. Including, in 
   each field of a row, the letter corresponding to the corresponding 
   spreadsheet column (including, for example, the text "(A)" for data in 
   spreadsheet column A) makes it easy to quickly determine if a field is 
   showing up on the AtoM side after import.

.. _csv-encoding-newline:

Verify character encoding and line endings
------------------------------------------

For your CSV files to import properly, you will need to ensure two things
prior to importing: that the `character encoding`_ of your CSV file is set to 
`UTF-8`_, and that the end-of-line characters used in your CSV conform to the 
Unix/Linux style of newline character.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Your import will likely **fail** if you don't ensure these two things are
   are correctly set prior to import! Please review the sub-sections below
   for further details.

   Note that AtoM includes a command-line task that can validate an import CSV
   for common issues (including a check for UTF-8 encoding and line endings),
   producing a report that flags errors that will cause the import to fail, as
   well as providing warnings on elements that will not halt the import, but
   could lead to unexpected results if unintended. This task is also supported
   via the :term:`user interface`, and can be run independently of import, as
   well as configured by an :term:`administrator` to run automatically before 
   any CSV import. 

   For more information including tips on how to troubleshoot encoding issues, 
   see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-utf8`

.. _csv-utf8-encoding:

Character encoding (UTF-8)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a CSV file to upload properly into AtoM (and display any special
characters such as accents contained in the data), your CSV file must use a
`UTF-8`_ character encoding. If you have used a Windows or Mac spreadsheet
application (such as Excel, for example), it's possible that the default
character encoding will **not** be UTF-8. For example, Excel uses
machine-specific ANSI encoding as its defaults during install, so an EN-US
installation might use Windows-1252 encoding by default, rather than something
more universal such as UTF-8 (the default encoding in AtoM). This can cause
problems on import into AtoM with special characters and diacritics. Make sure
that if you are using Excel or another spreadsheet application, you are
setting the character encoding to UTF-8. Many open source spreadsheet
programs, such as LibreOffice Calc, use UTF-8 by default, and include an easy
means for users to change the default encoding.

.. TIP::

   For Excel users, here is an quick guide on converting CSV files to UTF-8:
   
   * https://itstillworks.com/12530497/how-to-save-csv-in-utf-8

.. _csv-line-endings:

Line endings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

"In computing, a newline, also known as a line ending, end of line (EOL), or
line break, is a special character or sequence of characters signifying the
end of a line of text. The actual codes representing a newline vary across
operating systems, which can be a problem when exchanging text files between
systems with different newline representations." (Wikipedia entry on `Newline`_ )

Here are some of the differences:

* Unix / Linux / FreeBSD / OS X use LF (line feed, ``\n``, 0x0A)
* Macs prior to OS X use CR (carriage return, ``\r``, 0x0D)
* Windows / DOS use CR+LF (carriage return followed by line feed, ``\r\n``,
  0x0D0A)

AtoM's CSV import will expect Unix-style line breaks ( ``\n`` ). If you have
been using a spreadsheet application (such as Excel) on a Mac or Windows, you
may encounter import issues. There are many command-line utilities and free
software options out there to convert newline characters. Please ensure that
your spreadsheet is using the correct line endings prior to upload, otherwise
the upload will fail.

We recommend the use of LibreOffice `Calc`_ as an open source spreadsheet
application for preparing and managing CSV import metadata. By default, Calc
will allow you to configure the `character encoding`_ used to display a file 
each time it is opened, and will use the correct line-ending characters by 
default when a CSV file is saved using `UTF-8` encoding.

.. _csv-data-transformation:

Data transformation
-------------------

If you are working with a CSV export from another system (such a different
database), you may need to do further pre-processing to prepare your CSV. If
your previous system was designed for standards-compliance to a standard that
AtoM supports (see: :ref:`descriptive-standards`), the mapping process might
be simple - but if your system used custom data fields, mapping to one of the
supported standards could be trickier.

You may, for example, want to combine multiple CSV column values, that don't
cleanly map conceptually to AtoM-compatible CSV columns, into single columns
so they can be put into AtoM as notes. So *ColumnA* and *ColumnB* could be
combined into a *generalNote* column. This requires you to transform the data
before importing.

Depending on the size of your import data, this work can be done manually
using a spreadsheet program - simply cut and paste your data into the
corresponding cell in the provided import templates. However, for larger data
sets, data transformation can be done with custom programming (for example, a
Python script written by a :term:`developer`), open source tools such as 
`Open Refine`_ or `Pentaho Data Integration`_, or via a CSV transformation 
script.

We have included some guidelines for creating custom CSV transformation
scripts on the AtoM wiki. See:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_transformation

.. NOTE::

   Creating custom CSV scripts is an activity generally performed by a
   :term:`developer`.

.. _csv-testing-import:

Testing and validating your import
----------------------------------

AtoM includes a command-line task that can validate an import CSV for common
issues, producing a report that flags errors that will cause the import to fail, 
as well as providing warnings on elements that will not halt the import, but 
could lead to unexpected results if unintended. This task is also supported
via the :term:`user interface`, and can be run independently of import, as well
as configured by an :term:`administrator` to run automatically before any
CSV import. For more information, see: 

* :ref:`csv-validation`

Despite this, AtoM cannot validate the actual metadata included in each row -
meaning the CSV can in some cases be considered valid and well-formed, yet
still lead to undesirable results. For large imports in particular, it may be
wise to perform a test import first into a separate test instance of your
AtoM installation. 

To do so, you may want to clone your AtoM site and test your import on the
clone before importing to your production AtoM installation. This prevents you
from having to delete any improperly imported data. During import testing if
you want to delete all imported data you can use the command-line purge tool.

See: :ref:`cli-purge-data` in the Administrator's manual for more information.

Alternatively, the Docker and Vagrant development environments offer an easy
way to set up a test instance of AtoM on a personal computer, and could be used
for local import testing prior to a final import into a production site. For
more information, see: 

* :ref:`dev-env-vagrant`
* :ref:`dev-env-compose`

.. _csv-estimate-import-duration:

Estimating import duration
--------------------------

Once you've mapped the columns names in your CSV export to the corresponding
AtoM-compatible CSV column names and validated your initial metadata,  you may 
also wish to perform a test import.

A test import gives you an idea how long the import will take to complete on
your hardware. To estimate how long it will take to import 20,000 rows of CSV
data, for example, you could time the import of the first 1000 records and
multiply that by 20.

If your test import proves to be too slow on your hardware, or you don't have
hardware to spare, you can consider using cloud computing resources, such as
Open Hosting, Amazon EC2, or Rackspace Cloud.

.. _csv-legacy-id-mapping:

Legacy ID mapping: dealing with hierarchical data in a CSV
==========================================================

.. figure:: images/keymap-table.*
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 20%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Image of the the keymap table in AtoM's database

   A representation of the keymap table in AtoM, from an Entity Relationship
   Diagram of AtoM's MySQL database.

The *legacyId* column in imports is used to associate specific legacy data to
AtoM data using ID columns. Why would you need to associate this data? Let's
say you're importing a CSV file of description data you've exported from a
non-AtoM system. If the imported descriptions are in any way hierarchical --
with a fond containing items for example -- a column in a child description
will have to specify the legacy ID of its parent. The parent's legacy ID can
then be used to look up the AtoM ID of the parent that was imported earlier.
With the AtoM ID discovered, the parent/child relationship can then be
created. In addition to hierarchical description data, supplementary data such
as events must specify a legacy parent ID when imported.

When CSV data is imported into AtoM, values in the *legacyID* column are
stored in AtoM's keymap table, in a column named *source_id*. A system
administrator or :term:`developer` can access this information, either via
the command-line, or by using a graphical application such as
`phpMyAdmin <http://www.phpmyadmin.net>`__ to look up existing legacy ID values
in the *source_id* column of the MySQL keymap table.

.. NOTE::

   Even if you are importing your descriptions as top-level records, we still
   recommend using a ``legacyId`` value during import. Simply leave both the
   ``parentID`` and ``qubitParentSlug`` columns blank for any row you want to
   import as a top-level description.

In cases where data is being imported from multiple sources, legacy IDs may
conflict. Two datasets, for example, may have objects with an ID of 3. When
importing, you can use the command-line option ``--source-name`` to only record
or reference mappings for a specific data source. This will add a value in
the *source_name* column of AtoM's keymap table, which can then be used for
mapping subsequent imports.

.. TIP::

   There is no way to set the ``--source-name`` during an import conducted via
   the :term:`user interface`. Instead, the file name of the import is used as
   the source name value by default.

   You can always check what source name was used for records created via an
   import by entering into :term:`edit mode` and navigating to the
   Administration :term:`area <information area>` of the :term:`edit page` -
   the source name used will be displayed there:

   .. image:: images/source-name-ui.*
      :align: center
      :width: 90%
      :alt: An image of the source name used during import, shown in the
            Administration area of the AtoM edit page.

The following example shows an import of information objects that records a
specific source name when mapping legacy IDs to AtoM IDs:

.. code-block:: bash

    php symfony csv:import information_objects_rad.csv --source-name=collection_name

In the above example, ``collection_name`` represents the value added by the user
during import - now ``collection_name`` will be added to the *source_name* column
of the keymap table for all records imported. Given the above example, the
subsequent import of :ref:`events <csv-import-events>` using the following
command would make sure that they get associated with information objects from
the specific source identified as ``collection_name``:

.. code-block:: bash

  php symfony csv:event-import events.csv --source-name=collection_name

.. TIP::

   If you use the ``--source-name`` command-line option during your CSV
   import and you want to use spaces in the source name you add, you will
   need to enclose it in quotation marks. For example, both of the following
   are valid:

   ``php symfony csv:import information_objects_rad.csv --source-name=collection_name``

   or:

   ``php symfony csv:import information_objects_rad.csv --source-name="collection name"``

The ``--source-name`` option can also be used to keep larger imports that
have been broken into multiple CSV files related. Adding the ``--source-name``
option to each CSV import, with a common name added for each, will prevent
AtoM from duplicating import data, such as :term:`terms <term>` and actors
(:term:`authority records <authority record>`) during import.

For more information on command-line imports, see: :ref:`cli-import-export`.

.. _csv-import-descriptions:

Prepare archival descriptions for CSV import
============================================

The AtoM CSV import allows you to map CSV columns with specific headers to
AtoM data. Example RAD and ISAD CSV template files are available in AtoM source
code (``lib/task/import/example/rad/example_information_objects_rad.csv`` and
``lib/task/import/example/isad/example_information_objects_isad.csv``) or you
can download the files here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates#Archival_descriptions

The following section will introduce some of the relevant CSV columns so you
can prepare your archival descriptions for import.

* :ref:`csv-description-translations`

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`csv-validation`

.. _csv-description-hierarchies:

Hierarchical relationships
--------------------------

Information objects often have parent-child relationships - for example, a
series may be a :term:`child <child record>` of the fonds to which it belongs;
it has a :term:`parent <parent record>` fonds. If you want to import a
:term:`fonds` or :term:`collection` into AtoM along with its lower levels of
description (i.e. its children - series, files, items, etc.), you will need a
way to specify which rows in your CSV file belong to which parent description.

There are two basic ways to specify which information object is the parent of
an information object being imported in your CSV - either through the use of
the *legacyID* and *parentID* columns (generally used for new descriptions being
imported, or from descriptions being migrated from another access system), or
by using the *qubitParentSlug* column to import new child descriptions to an
existing description in AtoM.

.. WARNING::

   Note that if you set both the *parentId* and *qubitParentSlug* in a single row,
   the import will default to using the *qubitParentSlug*. In general, only one
   type of parent specification should be used for each imported information
   object (i.e. each row in your CSV).

You **can** use a mix of *legacyId/parentId* and *qubitParentSlug* in the
same CSV, just not in the same row. So, for example, if you wanted to import
a series description as a child of a description already in AtoM, as well as
several files as children of the series description, you could set a *legacyID*
for the series, use the *qubitParentSlug* to point to the parent fonds or
collection already in AtoM, and then use the *parentID* column for all your
lower-level file descriptions. However, using both *parentID* and
*qubitParentSlug* in the same row will cause a conflict, and AtoM will prefer
the *qubitParentSlug* so the import does not fail.

Both methods of establishing hierarchical relationships are described below.

* :ref:`csv-description-legacy-id`
* :ref:`csv-description-parent-slug`

.. NOTE::

   If you want your records to import as **top-level descriptions**, simply
   include a ``legacyID`` value, and leave both the ``parentID`` and
   ``qubitParentSlug`` columns blank for that row.

.. _csv-description-legacy-id:

LegacyID and parentID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One way  to establish hierarchical relationships during a CSV import involves
the use of the *parentId* column to specify a legacy ID (referencing the
*legacyId* column of a previously imported information object). This way is
most often used for migrations from other access systems. Using this method,
:term:`parent <parent record>` descriptions (e.g. :term:`fonds`,
:term:`collections <collection>`, etc) must appear **first** (i.e. above) in
your CSV and must include a legacyID - while  :term:`child records <child
record>` must appear **after** (i.e. below) their parent records in your CSV,
and must include the legacyID of the parent record in the *parentID* column.

Here is an example of the first three columns of a CSV file (shown in a
spreadsheet application), importing a **Fonds > Series > Item** hierarchy:

.. image:: images/csv-parentID-example.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: example CSV parentID rows

.. IMPORTANT::

   When the CSV is imported, it progresses row by row - meaning, if your CSV
   is not properly ordered with parent records appearing **before** their
   children, your import will fail!

Records in a CSV are imported sequentially, row by row. As each row is
imported, the legacyID value is added to AtoM's ``keymap`` table in the
database. When a *parentID* is encountered, AtoM will check the ``keymap`` table
for the corresponding *legacyID*. If a *parentID* value doesn't refer to the
*legacyID* of a previously imported description, AtoM's import logic will fall
back to check for an existing description with that internal object ID.

If there is still no match, then a warning will be included in the console
output (shown on the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page), and the record will
be imported as a top-level description. Be sure to double-check the results
post-import!

.. SEEALSO::

   * CSV validation - :ref:`csv-validation-legacyid`
   * CSV validation - :ref:`csv-validation-parent`

.. _csv-description-parent-slug:

qubitParentSlug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other method of importing hierarchical data into AtoM enables you to
specify an existing :term:`archival description` that doesn't have a legacyID
(one, for example, that has been manually created using the AtoM web
interface), and import descriptions as children of the target description(s).

To specify a parent that exists in AtoM, you must first take note of the
parent information object's :term:`slug`. The "slug" is a textual identifier
that is included in the URL used to view the parent description. If the URL,
for example, is `http://myarchive.com/AtoM/index.php/example-fonds` then
the slug will be `example-fonds`. This slug value would then be included in
your import in the *qubitParentSlug* column in the rows of children of the
parent description.

Alternately, if you are using the command-line to perform your import, you can
use the ``--default-parent-slug`` option in the command-line to set a default
slug value, that will be used when no *qubitParentSlug* or *parentID* values
have been included for the row. For more information, see the details in the
Administrator's manual on command-line CSV export:
:ref:`csv-import-descriptions-cli`.

Here is an example of the first few columns of a CSV file (shown in a
spreadsheet application), importing a new series to an existing
:term:`fonds`, and importing two new file-level descriptions to an existing
series:

.. image:: images/csv-qubitParentSlug-example.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: example CSV qubitParentSlug rows

If desired, you can mix the use of the *qubitParentSlug* column with the use
of the *parentID* column in the same CSV - for example, you could attach a
new series to an existing fonds by giving it a *legacyID* and the slug for the
existing fonds in the *qubitParentSlug* column, and then including
lower-level files attached to the new series by adding the *legacyID* of the
new series to the *parentID* column of the new files.

.. IMPORTANT::

   You should not add both a *parentID* and a *qubitParentSlug* to the **same
   row** - AtoM expects one or the other. When the import encounters both
   columns populated in a single row, AtoM will default to use the
   *qubitParentSlug* value. In general, each row must have **only** one or the
   other - either a parent slug, or a parent ID.

Creator-related import columns (actors and events)
--------------------------------------------------

The *eventActors*, *eventActorHistories*, *eventTypes*, *eventDates*,
*eventStartDates*, and *eventEndDates* columns are related to the creation of
actors and events. In AtoM's data model, an :term:`archival description` is a
description of a record, understood as the documentary evidence created by an
action - or event. It is events that link actors (represented in AtoM by an
:term:`authority record`) to archival descriptions - see :ref:`entity-types`
for more information.

The most common use for these columns is to add creation dates associated with
an actor via an :term:`authority record` - in this case, the *eventType* is
Creation, the *eventActor* is the creator, and the various *eventDates* fields
are the dates of creation associated with the description.

However, some standards support other types of events as well. For example,
the :ref:`ISAD(G) template <isad-template>` in AtoM also supports Accumulation
as an event type, while the Canadian :ref:`RAD template <rad-template>` allows
direct association between actors and events, and includes many other event
types, such as contribution, broadcasting, manufacturing, and more.

A brief summary of the fields is included below, followed by a longer
discussion of their use:

* ``eventActors``: Add the associated creator or other actor name here. AtoM
  will link to an existing :term:`authority record` or create a new one. For
  details on linking behavior, see below: :ref:`csv-actors-import`.
* ``eventActorHistories``: Add the associated creator or other actor's
  administrative or biographical history here. Equivalent to ISAD(G) 3.2.2,
  RAD 1.7B, and/or DACS 2.7 - Administrative/Biographical history. This will be
  mapped to the related :term:`authority record`.
* ``eventTypes``: Type of event. Values include:

  * **ISAD**: Creation, Accumulation
  * **RAD**: Creation, Accumulation, Contribution, Collection, Broadcasting,
    Manufacturing, Custody, Publication, Reproduction, Distribution

* ``eventDates``: Display dates shown in public user interface for event on
   archival description :term:`view page`. May use free-text, including
   typographical conventions to express approximation or uncertainty (e.g.
   [190-?]; [ca. 1885]).
* ``eventStartDates``: Internal `ISO 8601`_ formatted (e.g. YYYY, YYYY-MM,
   YYYY-MM-DD) start date of event
* ``eventEndDates``: Internal `ISO 8601`_ formatted (e.g. YYYY, YYYY-MM,
   YYYY-MM-DD) end date of event

* ``eventPlaces``: Only in RAD CSV templates. Associates a place with the
  event.

these fields can be pipe-separated (e.g. using the | pipe separator between
values).

.. _csv-actors-import:

On Authority records, archival descriptions, and CSV imports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AtoM tries to support the reusability of actor information through the
maintenance of :term:`authority records <authority record>` that can be linked
to :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` and other entities. This,
and the rationale for this, is outlined in greater detail in the following
sections:

* :ref:`authority-bioghist-access`
* :ref:`term-name-vs-subject`

This also affects how actor names are handled during a CSV import. Some of
the key behaviors are outlined below:

**Creating new actor records on import**

* AtoM looks for creator names in the *eventActors* column in the RAD and ISAD
  CSV import templates, as well as :term:`access point` names (used as subjects)
  in the *nameAccessPoints* column during a CSV import of
  :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`.
* Similarly, any Administrative / biographical history data in an archival
  description CSV import (i.e. data contained in the *eventActorHistories* CSV
  column will be mapped to the "History" :term:`field` (ISAAR-CPF 5.2.2) in the
  related :term:`authority record` (generated from the data contained in the
  *eventActors* column of the CSV), and then is presented in AtoM in any related
  descriptions where the entity is listed as a creator.
* Where multiple creator names and histories are included in an import,
  *eventActors* and *eventActorHistories* elements are matched 1:1 in the
  order they appear in the CSV, divided by pipe elements (e.g. ``|`` ). For
  example, if the *eventActors* column contains ``name 1|name 2``, the
  *eventActorHistories* should  also include ``history 1|history 2`` to match on
  import. If there is **no** history for the first actor, you can include
  ``NULL``, and AtoM will ignore the input - e.g. ``name 1|name 2`` should be
  matched with ``NULL|history 2`` to include only a history for name 2.
* This same ``NULL`` approach can be used for any matched date values where
  multiple actor names are included for import - ``eventDates``,
  ``eventStartDates``, ``eventEndDates`` can all include ``NULL`` if you wish
  to leave these blank when associating multiple actors with an event. An
  example, using the RAD template:

.. image:: images/csv-creatorDates-2.*
   :align: center
   :width: 99%
   :alt: example CSV actor and event rows from the RAD template

* If a creator history element is included in a CSV import, but **no** creator
  name is included, AtoM will still automatically generate a stub
  :term:`authority record` and map the history data to the "History"
  :term:`field` (ISAAR-CPF 5.2.2) - the authority record will be left
  untitled, until the user manually adds the appropriate :term:`name` to the
  authority record. Similarly, if there are more *eventActorHistories* elements
  included in an import than  creator names included in the *eventActors* column,
  the final biographical/administrative history will be mapped to an
  untitled authority record. Because the :term:`slug` is normally based on the
  title of the authority record, AtoM will generate a random alphanumeric
  string to use as the slug - and you will **not** be able to edit this
  through the user interface.

.. _csv-actor-matching:

Attempting to match to existing authority records on import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. IMPORTANT::

   If you are attempting to import both an :term:`archival description` CSV
   and an :term:`authority record` CSV to supplement the actor data that is
   linked to your descriptions, **you must import the authority record CSV
   first**. On import, the description CSV code will look for exact matches to
   which it can link - but the authority record CSV import code does not
   currently have similar logic. If you import your authority record CSV
   template after the description CSV, you might end up creating duplicate
   authority records!

During an archival description CSV import, AtoM will attempt to find matches
for current authority records, and link to those instead of creating new ones
during import when possible. However, to avoid collisions, or situations in
which multiple imports overwrite the same authority record in a
:term:`multi-repository system`, the approach is conservative - for a match to
be made and a link to an existing record added instead of a new record being
created, the authorized form of name must be an *exact* match, **and** the
existing authority record in AtoM must be linked to the same repository as the
incoming records' repository column value. The presence of a matching or
different actor history, and the import type (import as new, match and update,
or delete and replace) can also affect how actor linking behaves during a CSV
import.

This means that **users should be careful to double check authority
linking behaviors in AtoM following an import**, and manually perform any
desired adjustments where needed.

For more information on linking an authority record to a repository, see:
:ref:`link-repo-actor`. For more information on the different types of imports,
see below.

Below is a table summarizing the actor matching behavior on CSV imports of
archival descriptions. It is followed by an explanation of the columns.

**Table legend**

* **#**: Scenario number
* **Import type**: AtoM's CSV import supports 3 modes - import a record as
  new (ignore any matches found); find matches and update the record in place;
  or find matches, delete the existing record, and import the current record
  as a replacement. See more on how to use these options
  :ref:`below <csv-descriptions-updates>`.
* **Match on name**: Whether or not the CSV row's ``eventActors`` value matches
  the existing authority record's authorized form of name.
* **Match on repository**: Whether or not the CSV row's ``repository`` value
  matches the Maintaining repository linked to the existing authority record.
  AtoM includes the ability to link an authority record directly to a
  repository, and this is used as a match parameter during import. For more
  information on linking authority records to a repository, see:
  :ref:`link-repo-actor`.  Note that during match and update imports, a blank
  value in a CSV is ignored (the original data is not modified) - hence "Yes
  (or blank)" as a response in some cases.
* **Match on history**: Whether or not the CSV row's ``eventActorHistories``
  value matches the biographical or administrative history associated with the
  existing authority record. Note that during match and update imports, a
  blank value in a CSV is ignored (the original data is not modified) - hence
  "Yes (or blank)" as a response in some cases.
* **Outcome**: Based on the variables in the other columns, whether or not the
  CSV import will result in linking to an existing authority record (and
  whether or not any parts of the authority record is updated), or if a new
  actor is created by the import instead.

**Scenario summaries**

**1**: If you are importing a CSV and there is a match to an existing
authority record's authorized form of name, history, and the repository the
existing authority record is linked to matches the repository in the CSV for
the related description, then AtoM will link to the existing authority record.

**2A**: If you are importing new records or trying to update existing ones
using "Delete and replace" and there's a match on authority record name AND
maintaining institution BUT NOT on the admin/bio history, AtoM will create a
new authority record, instead of overwriting the match's existing history. If
you wanted to update the existing admin/bio history instead, use the "Match
and update" option instead.

**2B**: If you are trying to update existing descriptions using the "Match and
update" option  and there's a match on authority record name AND maintaining
institution BUT NOT on the admin/bio history, then AtoM will link to the
existing authority record but update the current admin/bio history to the data
included in the CSV. If you don't want this to happen, you can either
exclude the admin/bio history (in which case, no changes will be made to the
linked authority record) or use the "Delete and replace" import option
instead (in which case a new authority record will be created).

**3**: If you are importing new descriptions or trying to update existing ones
and there's a match on an authority record's name AND the history is either
blank or also matches exactly on the existing authority record, BUT the
maintaining repository does NOT match (or is blank on the existing authority
record), then AtoM will link to the existing authority record without making
any changes to it.

**4**: If you are importing new descriptions or trying to update existing ones
and there's a match on an authority record's name BUT neither the repository
NOR the admin/biog history matches, then a new authority record will be created
(to avoid overwriting another institution's history). If you want to link to
an existing authority record, omit the history from your CSV import or make it
exactly match the existing one.

**5**: If you are importing new descriptions or trying to update existing ones
and there is NO match to any existing authority records on the authorized form
of the name of the actor in your import CSV, then AtoM will create a new
authority record on import. You cannot use the descriptions CSV import to
update the authorized form of name of a linked authority record.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Even with the "Delete and replace" update option **only** the related
   archival description is deleted - existing authority records and other
   entities (e.g. :term:`access points <access point>`, etc) are not
   automatically deleted. If you have created a new authority record, make
   sure you remember to manually delete any superceded versions!

.. _csv-descriptions-digital-objects:

Digital object-related import columns
-------------------------------------

As of AtoM 2.1, two new columns have been added to the 
:ref:`ISAD <isad-template>` and :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` CSV import
templates: ``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI``. These columns will
allow you to link or upload a :term:`digital object` and attach it to the new
:term:`information object` being created in that row of the CSV.

In AtoM, a 1:1 relationship is maintained between information objects and
digital objects - meaning that for every :term:`archival description`, you can
only attach one :term:`digital object`. If you wish, you can create new
:term:`child records <child record>` - a number of item descriptions as
children of a file-level description; a number of part descriptions as
children of an item (for multiple views of a single object, for example, or
individual pages of a single book uploaded separately, etc), and so on.

In the CSV templates, the ``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI``
columns are positioned *after* the ``publicationStatus`` column, and *before*
the physical object-related import columns.

.. image:: images/csv-digital-object-columns-location.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: example CSV digitalObject rows

The ``digitalObjectPath`` column can be used to upload local digital objects -
simply provide a complete path and filename to the digital object.

The ``digitalObjectURI`` column can be used to link to externally hosted,
publicly available digital objects, such as those available at a specific URL
on the web. You must have a path directly to the digital object which includes
a file extension, and not just to a web page with a digital object located on
it somewhere - it is often the equivalent of right-clicking on a digital
object in your browser and selecting "View image".

You can use a mixture of the ``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI``
columns throughout your CSV (linking some information object rows to locally
uploaded digital objects, and others to web-based resources), but you cannot
use both columns in the same row. If AtoM encounters a CSV row where both the
``digitalObjectPath`` and ``digitalObjectURI`` columns are populated, it will
favor the ``digitalObjectURI`` value, and ignore the ``digitalObjectPath``
value.

.. TIP::

   AtoM includes a command-line task that can be used to double-check your
   CSV's ``digitalObjectPath`` values  against a :term:`digital object`
   directory, looking for any discrepancies such as unused files, incorrect or
   duplicate file paths in the CSV, etc. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-check-filepaths-digital-objects`

   There is also a more robust validation task that, if run from the 
   command-line, can check digital object file paths as well as a number of other
   common issues. For more information, see: 

   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli-task`

.. _csv-descriptions-storage:

Physical object-related import columns
--------------------------------------

The *physicalObjectName*, *physicalObjectLocation*, and *physicalObjectType*
columns are related to the creation of physical objects and physical storage
locations related to an :term:`archival description`.

.. image:: images/csv-physical-object.*
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: example CSV physicalObject rows

These fields will also support ``|`` pipe separators to add multiple physical
storage containers per row. When piping one column, each related column must
also be piped correspondingly:

.. image:: images/csv-physical-object-piped.*
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: example CSV physicalObject rows

For more information on working with physical storage in AtoM, see:
:ref:`physical-storage`. AtoM also supports command-line imports of physical 
storage data - for more information, see: :ref:`csv-import-storage-cli`. 

.. IMPORTANT::

   If your description CSV import contains physical storage information, the
   CSV file must contain information in both of the physical object storage
   fields: ``physicalObjectName`` and ``physicalObjectLocation``. Entering
   information in ``physicalObjectName`` only will result in the creation of
   duplicates, since AtoM defaults to duplicates rather than accidentally
   merging separate records with the same location. For example, several
   collections may contain ``physicalObjectName`` Box 1, but adding
   ``physicalObjectLocation`` Shelf 1 will differentiate it from Box 1 on
   Shelf 5.

.. _csv-description-standards-fields:

Standards related fields
-------------------------

Most fields in the CSV templates have been named in a fairly obvious way,
translating a simplified version of the field name in our data entry
templates into a condensed `camelCase`_. For example, the Rules for Archival 
Description's (:ref:`RAD <rad-template>`) "General Material Designation" is 
rendered in the CSV column header as ``radGeneralMaterialDesignation``. In 
both the RAD and :ref:`ISAD <isad-template>`> templates, the Scope and Content 
field is mapped to the CSV column name ``scopeAndContent``. However, for users 
seeking a full mapping of fields, consult the :ref:`RAD template <rad-template>` 
and :ref:`ISAD(G) template <isad-template>` pages for further details.

.. TIP::

   If you would like to better understand how AtoM's import columns map to 
   supported data entry fields in your chosen template, try importing one of 
   `CSV import templates`_ found on the AtoM wiki. Each field in these 
   templates is populated with example data that includes the name of the 
   related standards-based field - for example, the example data in the ISAD(G)
   import template for the ``scopeAndContent`` field is "Example fonds Scope 
   and content (ISAD 3.3.1)". Comparing the example data in your import 
   template with the resulting record in AtoM should help you better understand
   how the column names map to AtoM's standard-based data entry fields. 

The ``culture`` column indicates to AtoM the default language of the descriptions
being uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code
values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian,
etc. See Wikipedia for a full list of `ISO 639-1`_ language codes, and see
the following link for a full list of AtoM supported languages and corresponding
culture codes:

.. _csv-descriptions-other-fields:

Other data entry notes
----------------------

* *language* and *languageOfDescription*, like *culture*, expect two-letter
  ISO 639-1 language code values - for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French,
  "it" for Italian, etc. See Wikipedia for a full list of `ISO 639-1`_ language 
  codes. Unlike the *culture* column,  however, these two fields will accept 
  multiple values separated by a pipe character - for example, ``en|fr|it``.
* The *script* and *scriptOfDescription* columns expect four-letter ISO 15924
  script code values - for example, "Latn" for Latin-based scripts, "Cyrl"
  for Cyrillic scripts, etc. See `Unicode`_ for a full list of ISO 15924 script 
  codes.
* Alternative identifiers and their display labels can be imported using the
  *alternativeIdentifiers* and *alternativeIdentifierLabels* columns. Use pipe
  (``|``) separators to add multiple values. There should be a 1:1 relationship
  between the number of identifier values in the *alternativeIdentifiers* column
  and corresponding labels in the *alternativeIdentifierLabels* column.
* An *accessionNumber* column can be added to create a link between an existing
  accession record and an archival description being imported via CSV. See the
  section on Accession CSV import :ref:`below <csv-import-accessions>` for more
  information.

   values in the language, script, and culture columns of a CSV. For more
   information, see: 

   * :ref:`csv-validation`

.. _csv-description-translations:

Importing translations
----------------------

As of version 2.6, AtoM will allow you to import new descriptions in multiple
languages at once, as a way of adding translations to your source content during
an import.

At this time, not all CSV fields support translation imports. Only
those fields found in AtoM's ``information_object_i18n`` database table can
be imported as translations. These include:

* title
* alternateTitle
* radEdition
* extentAndMedium
* archivalHistory
* acquisition
* scopeAndContent
* appraisal
* accruals
* arrangement
* accessConditions
* reproductionConditions
* physicalCharacteristics
* findingAids
* locationOfOriginals
* locationOfCopies
* relatedUnitsOfDescription
* rules
* sources
* revisionHistory
* institutionIdentifier

The translation import works on the following logic: whenever AtoM encounters
two consecutive CSV rows that have the **same** ``legacyId`` value, but
**different** ``culture`` values, AtoM will import the second row as a
translation of the first. AtoM expects two-letter ISO 639-1 culture codes to
be used in the ``culture`` column - e.g. ``en`` for English, ``fr`` for
French, etc. See the section above, :ref:`csv-descriptions-other-fields`, for
further information.

**Preparing translations for import**

To import new archival descriptions with translations:

* Make sure that every row in your CSV has a ``legacyId`` and a ``culture``
  value
* Place translation rows directly below the source culture row
* Translation rows must have the **same** ``legacyId`` value as their source
  culture rows
* Translation rows must have a **different** ``culture`` value as their source
  culture rows
* Make sure that all ``culture`` values use `ISO 639-1`_ two-letter codes
* In the translation rows, leave any columns that do not support translation
  blank

An example CSV:

.. image:: images/csv-translation-example.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: An example CSV with translation rows included

.. TIP::

   Most fields that can't currently be translated via CSV import can still be
   translated via AtoM's :term:`user interface`. For more information on
   translating content via the user interface, see:

   * :ref:`translate-content`

   Remember that linked :term:`entities <entity>` (such as a :term:`creator`
   name, a subject :term:`access point`, or other :term:`terms <term>` that
   are maintained in taxonomies such as the Levels of description, etc)
   cannot be translated directly on the :term:`archival description` edit
   page. Instead, navigate to the linked entity, flip the user interface into
   the desired translation culture, enter edit mode, add your translation, and
   save. When you return to your description and view it in the translation
   culture, the translated entity will now also display in the translation
   culture.

.. _csv-import-descriptions-gui:

Import new archival descriptions via CSV
========================================

The following section will introduce how an :term:`archival description` CSV of
new records can be imported into AtoM via the user interface. AtoM also has
the ability to use a CSV import to update existing descriptions - for more
information on this, see :ref:`below <csv-descriptions-updates>`.

When importing new records, AtoM can also check for existing records that seem
to match the descriptions you are about to import, and skip these records if
desired - they will be reported in the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page
of the related import job (see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information). This
can be useful if you are uncertain if some of the records in your CSV have been
previously imported - such as when passing records to a portal site or union
catalogue. For more information on the criteria used during a CSV import to
identify matches, see below, :ref:`csv-descriptions-match-criteria`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the instructions
   above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Here is a basic checklist
   of things to check for importing a CSV of archival descriptions via the
   user interface:

   * CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * All :term:`parent <parent record>` descriptions appear in rows **above**
     their children
   * All new parent records have a *legacyID* value, and all
     :term:`children <child record>` include the parent's *legacyID* value in
     their *parentID* column
   * No row uses both *parentID* and *qubitParentSlug* (only one should be used
     - if both are present AtoM will default to using the *qubitParentSlug*)
   * Any records to be imported as children of an existing record in AtoM use
     the proper *qubitParentSlug* of the existing parent record
   * If you have physical storage data in your CSV, you have ensured that all
     3 physical storage columns are populated with data to avoid the
     accidental creation of duplicate storage locations (see above,
     :ref:`csv-descriptions-storage`)
   * You have reviewed any other relevant data entry guidelines in the section
     above: :ref:`csv-import-descriptions`
   * You have reviewed how the :ref:`authority record matching <csv-actor-matching>`
     behavior works above, and know what to expect with your import.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
descriptions.

**To import a CSV file via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: The import menu

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. To import new archival
   descriptions, Make sure that the "Type" :term:`drop-down menu` is set to
   "Archival description" and the Update behaviors drop-down is set to "Ignore
   matches and create new records on import."

.. image:: images/csv-import-page.*

   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM

3. AtoM can check for existing records that seem to match the descriptions
   you are about to import, and skip these records if desired - they will be
   reported in the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job (see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information). To enable this option
   and skip matched records, click the checkbox labelled "Skip matched
   records."

4. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be
   discoverable via search or browse in the user interface! You will need to
   know the exact URL to reach them. To make them visible in the interface
   again, a system administrator will need to rebuild the search index. See:
   :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`.

5. When you have configured your import options, click the "Browse" button to
   open a window on your local computer. Select the CSV file that you would
   like to import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

6. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-start.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: Starting a CSV import in AtoM

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, you can always check on the status of an
   import by reviewing the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related
   import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

7. After your import is complete, AtoM will indicate that the import has been
   initiated. A notification at the top of the page will also provide you with
   a link to the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job. Alternatively, you can click the "Back" button in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the page to return to the CSV import
   page, or navigate elsewhere in the application.

.. image:: images/csv-import-completed.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: When a CSV import has been initiated in AtoM

.. TIP::

   Want to find your recent imports? You can use the
   :ref:`sort buttons <recurring-sort-button>` located in the top-right hand
   side of the archival description browse page to change the results display
   to be ordered by "Date modified" in "Descending" direction if they are not
   already - that way, the most recently added or edited descriptions will
   appear at the top of the results. If you have come directly here after
   importing your descriptions, they should appear at the top of the results.

   .. image:: images/csv-import-browse-page.*
      :align: center
      :width: 85%
      :alt: The browse page following a CSV import

8. If any warnings or errors are encountered, AtoM will display them on
   :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.
   Generally, errors will cause an import to fail, while warnings will be
   logged but will allow the import to proceed anyway - however, an 
   :term:`administrator` can configure the CSV import validation to run 
   automatically on all imports, and when this setting is set to "strict" even
   warnings will prevent a CSV import from proceeding. For more information, 
   see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validator-settings`

   Errors and warnings can occur for many reasons - please review the checklist
   :ref:`above <csv-import-descriptions-gui>` for suggestions on resolving
   the most common reasons that CSV imports fail. Note that validation can also
   be run independently of an import - doing so via the :term:`user interface` 
   will also generate a downloadable TXT file report with further details on 
   errors and warnings encountered, that should help you troubleshoot any 
   issues. See the :ref:`csv-validation` documentation for further details.  

   In the example error pictured below, the CSV includes a ``qubitParentSlug`` 
   value for a description that does not exist - so AtoM cannot attach the CSV 
   row description to its intended parent:

.. _csv-descriptions-updates:

Update existing descriptions via CSV import
===========================================

AtoM's CSV import includes the ability to use the import to update existing
descriptions in two different ways, depending on the outcome desired. After
attempting to identify existing matches, AtoM can either delete the existing
match and replace it with the matched row in the CSV import, or it can attempt
to use the matched CSV row to update the description in-place with new data.
Both options (and their limitations) will be explained further below, along
with the additional import options available when importing updates.

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`csv-descriptions-update-fields`
* :ref:`csv-descriptions-match-criteria`
* :ref:`csv-descriptions-update-match`
* :ref:`csv-descriptions-delete-replace`
* :ref:`csv-descriptions-updates-ui`

.. _csv-descriptions-update-fields:

Fields that will support update imports
---------------------------------------

Currently, not all fields in AtoM's :term:`archival description` metadata
templates can be updated via import. Only those fields which are found in AtoM's
primary ``information_object`` and ``information_object_i18n`` database tables
will support updates in place. Below is a list of supported fields:

* title
* identifier
* levelOfDescription
* repository
* alternateTitle (in the RAD CSV template)
* radEdition (in the RAD CSV template)
* extentAndMedium
* archivalHistory
* acquisition
* scopeAndContent
* appraisal
* accruals
* arrangement
* language
* script
* accessConditions
* reproductionConditions
* physicalCharacteristics
* findingAids
* locationOfOriginals
* locationOfCopies
* relatedUnitsOfDescription
* digitalObjectPath
* digitalObjectURI
* rules
* languageOfDescription
* scriptOfDescription
* sources
* descriptionStatus
* levelOfDetail
* revisionHistory
* institutionIdentifier
* alternativeIdentifiers
* alternativIdentifierLabels

.. IMPORTANT::

   Please note that, while title, identifier, and repository **can** be updated
   via CSV import, they are also used as part of the matching criteria when
   importing updates via the user interface. As such, trying to update these
   fields via CSV import may cause the matching to fail.

   See below for further information on AtoM's import matching criteria:

   * :ref:`csv-descriptions-match-criteria`

   Note that the command-line import task includes a ``--roundtrip`` option that,
   when used with the ``--update`` option, limits matching to the objectID value
   (included in the legacyID column on export). Using this option can allow for
   updates to title, identifier, and repository, since the only matching criteria
   used is the legacyID value in your import CSV. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-import-descriptions-cli`

There are also additional fields that are not stored in AtoM's primary
:term:`information object` database tables that can potentially receive new data
via an update import. In these cases, existing data will **not** be replaced -
instead, the update import will append **new** data to the existing resources.
These fields typically relate to note fields (such as all the custom note types
in the :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` and :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>` templates), or
linked :term:`entities <entity>` such as :term:`terms <term>`,
:term:`authority records <authority record>`, etc.

Below is a list of fields to which new data can be appended via an update
import - any existing data will be left in place:

* accessionNumber
* radGeneralMaterialDesignation
* radTitleStatementOfResponsibilityNote
* radTitleAttributionsAndConjectures
* radTitleContinues
* radTitleSourceOfTitleProper
* radTitleVariationsInTitle
* radTitleParallelTitles
* subjectAccessPoints
* placeAccessPoints
* genreAccessPoints
* nameAccessPoints
* radNoteAccompanyingMaterial
* radNoteAlphaNumericDesignation
* radNoteConservation
* radNoteEdition
* radNotePhysicalDescription
* radNotePublisherSeries
* radNoteRights
* radNoteCast
* radNoteCredits
* radNoteSignaturesInscriptions
* generalNote
* archivistNote
* physicalObjectName
* physicalObjectLocation
* physicalObjectType

Finally, please note that ``eventActors`` (i.e. :term:`creators <creator>` and
other actors associated with different event types) and other related ``event``
fields are a special case. Please see the table in the section above to
determine the matching criteria and resulting behavior:

* :ref:`csv-actor-matching`

.. _csv-descriptions-match-criteria:

Matching criteria for archival descriptions
-------------------------------------------

AtoM uses the following cascading criteria when checking for matches on
existing archival descriptions during a CSV import:

* First AtoM will look for an exact match in the ``legacyID`` and the
  ``source_name`` value (for more information on ``source_name``, see above:
  :ref:`csv-legacy-id-mapping`). During a CSV import via the user interface,
  the default source name value stored will be the filename of the CSV.

.. TIP::

   You can always check what source name was used for records created via an
   import by entering into :term:`edit mode` and navigating to the
   Administration :term:`area <information area>` of the :term:`edit page` -
   the source name used will be displayed there:

   .. image:: images/source-name-ui.*
      :align: center
      :width: 90%
      :alt: An image of the source name used during import, shown in the
            Administration area of the AtoM edit page.

* If no match is found on ``legacyID`` and ``source_name``, then AtoM will
  look for an exact match on **title, repository, and identifier**.
* If there is no exact match on all of these 3 values, then the record is
  considered not to have a match. Depending on user settings during import, it
  will either import as new, or be skipped and reported in the Job details page.

.. TIP::

   AtoM's command-line CSV import includes an additional option, called
   ``--roundtrip``, that bypasses the above set of criteria. Instead, it will
   **only** look for an exact match on the legacyID value in your import CSV,
   against the unique internal database object ID associated with every record.
   AtoM populates the ``legacyId`` column with objectID values during export,
   so this option is useful when roundtripping (AKA exporting a CSV, updating
   its metadata, and then re-importing it as an update) in the same system. It's
   also useful when you want to update the title, identifier, and repository
   values of a description, since otherwise these are used as matching criteria.

   For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-import-descriptions-cli`

The **default behavior** when no match is found during an updates import is to
import the record as a new description. However, AtoM does have an option in
the user interface (and in the command-line options) to skip unmatched
records. When this option is selected, any records that do not match
existing descriptions will be ignored during the import, and reported in the
console log shown on the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related
import job (see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information). This is recommended
if you are intending to only import updates to existing records.

.. image:: images/csv-match-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: An image of the matching options on the CSV import page

.. WARNING::

   If you are working with hierarchical data and you include a ``parentID``
   value in a CSV import that cannot be matched on import (for example, the
   parent is not included in the CSV, and a matching parentID is not found in
   the keymap table during import, AtoM will add the record as a top-level
   description. The console output shown on the :ref:`Job details <job-details>`
   page of the related import job will say "attaching to root" for that
   record.

   If you don't want this to happen, make sure you use the "Skip unmatched"
   option!

You can also narrow the scope of the matching criteria to either records
linked to a specific :term:`repository` (i.e. an :term:`archival institution`),
or a specific :term:`archival unit` (i.e. a top-level description such as a
:term:`fonds` or :term:`collection`, etc.). To avoid contradictory options,
AtoM will only allow one of these parameters to be specified at a time. These
options are useful for ensuring that you are matching the correct descriptions
before updating them - for example, when importing updates to the records of
one specific institution into a :term:`multi-repository system`.

.. _csv-descriptions-update-match:

Update matches in place
-----------------------

AtoM's first option for updates allows you to use incoming CSV data as an
update to existing descriptions. Whenever a match is found for an existing
description, AtoM will use the data in the CSV to update the related
:term:`field` in place. If a column is left blank in the updates CSV, it will
be ignored (it will not overwrite existing data by erasing it).

To import a CSV as updates to existing descriptions, select the option
"Update matches ignoring blank fields in CSV" from the "Update behaviours"
:term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV import page.

.. image:: images/csv-update-match.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the Update matches option in the CSV import user
         interface

.. IMPORTANT::

   AtoM can only update description fields that are stored in the primary
   information object database table using this method. This means that
   related entities (such as :term:`events <event>`,
   :term:`creators <creator>`, :term:`access points <access point>`,
   physical storage locations, etc.) **cannot be deleted or updated with this
   method**. You can add additional related entities, but the old ones will be
   left in place. There is code to prevent duplication however - so if you
   have left the same creator/event information as previously, it will be
   ignored.

   The one exception to this is updating the biographical or administrative
   history of a related :term:`authority record`, which requires specific
   criteria. See scenario **2B** in the section above,
   :ref:`csv-actor-matching`.

   Additionally, in AtoM notes are stored in a different database table - this
   includes the General note, Archivist's note, and the RAD- and DACS-specific
   note type fields in AtoM's archival description templates. This means that
   in addition to related entities, **notes cannot be deleted or updated with
   this method**

   If you wish to make updates to these entities or fields, consider using
   the "Delete and replace" update option instead - though be sure to read up
   on the behavior and limitations of that method as well!

If a match is not found during the import, the default behavior is to import
the CSV row as a new record. If you are only importing updates, we recommend
clicking the checkbox for the "Skip unmatched records" - AtoM will then skip
any unmatched CSV rows and report them in the console log shown on the
:ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.

Specific instructions on configuring the :term:`user interface` for import are
included below - see: :ref:`csv-descriptions-updates-ui`.

.. _csv-descriptions-delete-replace:

Delete matches and replace with imported records
------------------------------------------------

AtoM's second update option allows you to identify matched descriptions during
import, and then delete the matches prior to importing the CSV data as a new
record to replace it.

Note that **only** the matched :term:`archival description` and its
:term:`children <child record>` are deleted during this process. Any
related/linked :term:`entities <entity>` (such as an :term:`authority record`
linked as a :term:`creator`, subject/place/name/genre
:term:`access points <access point>`, linked
:term:`accession <accession record>` records, physical storage locations,
etc.) **are not automatically deleted**. If you want these fully removed, you
will have to find them and manually delete them via the user interface after
the import.

Once the original matched archival description has been deleted, the CSV
import proceeds as if the record is new. That is to say, just as AtoM does not
automatically delete related entities in the original archival
description, it *also* not automatically re-link previously related entities.
Instead, AtoM will use its default matching behaviors to determine if related
entities in the import (such as a :term:`creator` in the ``eventActors`` CSV
column) should be linked to existing records in AtoM, or created as new
records during the import. AtoM's matching criteria for authority records is
outlined above - see: :ref:`csv-actor-matching`

To import an archival description CSV of records as replacements for existing
descriptions in AtoM, select the "Delete matches and replace with imported
records" option from the "Update behaviours" :term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV
import page.

.. image:: images/csv-update-delete.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the Delete and replace updates option in the CSV import
         user interface

If a match is not found during the import, the default behavior is to import
the CSV row as a new record. If you are only importing updates, you can click
the checkbox for the "Skip unmatched records" if desired - AtoM will then skip
any unmatched CSV rows and report them in the console log shown on the
:ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.

.. WARNING::

   It is very difficult to use the "Skip unmatched records" option with a
   "Delete and replace" import when working with hierarchical data. Once a
   match is found for the top-level description (e.g. the root
   :term:`parent record`), AtoM will then proceed to delete the
   original description and all of its :term:`children <child record>` (e.g.
   lower level records). This means that when AtoM gets to the next child row
   in the CSV, it will find no match in the database - because it has already
   deleted the children - and the records will therefore be skipped and not
   imported.

   Unless you are **only** updating standalone descriptions (e.g. descriptions
   with no children), we do not recommend using the "Skip unmatched records"
   with the "Delete and replace" import update method.

Specific instructions on configuring the :term:`user interface` for import are
included below - see: :ref:`csv-descriptions-updates-ui`.

.. _csv-descriptions-updates-ui:

Importing updates via the user interface
----------------------------------------

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the preparation
   instructions above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Here is a
   basic checklist of things to check for importing a CSV of archival
   descriptions updates via the user interface:

   * CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * All :term:`parent <parent record>` descriptions appear in rows **above**
     their children
   * All new parent records have a *legacyID* value, and all
     :term:`children <child record>` include the parent's *legacyID* value in
     their *parentID* column
   * No row uses both *parentID* and *qubitParentSlug* (only one should be used
     - if both are present AtoM will default to using the *qubitParentSlug*)
   * Any records to be imported as children of an existing record in AtoM use
     the proper *qubitParentSlug* of the existing parent record
   * You have reviewed the list of :ref:`csv-descriptions-update-fields`
   * You have reviewed how the :ref:`authority record matching <csv-actor-matching>`
     behavior works above, and know what to expect with your import.
   * If you are using the "Delete and replace" method with hierarchical data -
     don't use the "Skip unmatched records" option as well (see above,
     :ref:`csv-descriptions-delete-replace`).
   * If you are using the "Update matches ignoring blank fields in CSV"
     option, you have reviewed which entities and fields cannot be updated
     using this method (see above, :ref:`csv-descriptions-update-match`).

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
updates.

**To import a CSV file of description updates via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: The import menu

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Archival description" .

.. image:: images/csv-import-page.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM

3. Select the type of update import you want to initiate.

   To update existing archival descriptions in place, select the option
   "Update matches ignoring blank fields in CSV" from the "Update behaviours"
   :term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV import page.

   .. image:: images/csv-update-match.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :alt: An image of the Update matches option in the CSV import user
            interface

   To delete existing matched archival descriptions and replace them with the
   data in your CSV, select the "Delete matches and replace with imported
   records" option from the "Update behaviours" :term:`drop-down menu` on the
   CSV import page.

   .. image:: images/csv-update-delete.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :alt: An image of the Delete and replace updates option in the CSV import
            user interface

.. TIP::

   You can read more about each update option in the sections above:

   * :ref:`csv-descriptions-update-match`
   * :ref:`csv-descriptions-delete-replace`

4. AtoM's default behavior when it cannot find a match during an update import
   is to import the CSV row as a new record. However, if you are **only**
   importing updates and don't want to accidentally create new records when no
   match is found, you can check the "Skip unmatched records" checkbox. Any
   unmatched records will not be imported - instead, skipped records will be
   reported in the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job (see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information).

.. image:: images/csv-match-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The Match options available on the archival description CSV import
         page.

5. To improve the default matching behavior (described in detail above:
   :ref:`csv-descriptions-match-criteria`), you can provide further criteria
   to help AtoM find the correct match. You can limit the matches to either
   the :term:`holdings` of a specific :term:`repository`, or if you are
   updating a single :term:`archival unit`, you can limit matches to a
   specific top-level description. To prevent contradictory options, these
   limiters are mutually exclusive - you cannot pick a repository AND a
   top-level description.

   To limit your matches to the holdings of a specific
   :term:`archival institution`, use the :term:`drop-down menu` to select the
   name of the related institution

   To limit your matches to a specific top-level description, place your
   cursor in the "Top-level description" field and begin to slowly type the
   name of the top-level description. This :term:`field` is an autocomplete
   menu - as you begin to type, AtoM will display matching records in the
   :term:`drop-down menu` that will appear below. When you see the top-level
   description you want to use as a match limit, click on it in the drop-down
   menu to select it.

6. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be
   discoverable via search or browse in the user interface! You will need to
   know the exact URL to reach them. To make them visible in the interface
   again, a system administrator will need to rebuild the search index. See:
   :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`.

7. When you have configured your import options, click the "Browse" button to
   open a window on your local computer. Select the CSV file that you would
   like to import as your update.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

8. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, you can always check on the status of an
   import by reviewing the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related
   import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

9. After your import is complete, AtoM will indicate that the import has been
   initiated. A notification at the top of the page will also provide you with
   a link to the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job. Alternatively, you can click the "Back" button in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the page to return to the CSV import
   page, or navigate elsewhere in the application.

.. TIP::

   Want to find your recently updated records? You can use the
   :ref:`sort buttons <recurring-sort-button>` located in the top-right hand
   side of the archival description browse page to change the results display
   to be ordered by "Date modified" in "Descending" direction if they are not
   already - that way, the most recently added or edited descriptions will
   appear at the top of the results. If you have come directly here after
   importing your descriptions, they should appear at the top of the results.

10. If any warnings or errors are encountered, AtoM will display them on
    :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.
    Generally, errors will cause an import to fail, while warnings will be
    logged but will allow the import to proceed anyway - however, an 
    :term:`administrator` can configure the CSV import validation to run 
    automatically on all imports, and when this setting is set to "strict" even
    warnings will prevent a CSV import from proceeding. For more information, 
    see:

    * :ref:`csv-validation`
    * :ref:`csv-validator-settings`

    Errors and warnings can occur for many reasons - please review the checklist
    :ref:`above <csv-descriptions-updates-ui>` for suggestions on resolving
    the most common reasons that CSV imports fail. Note that validation can also
    be run independently of an import - doing so via the :term:`user interface` 
    will also generate a downloadable TXT file report with further details on 
    errors and warnings encountered, that should help you troubleshoot any 
    issues. See the :ref:`csv-validation` documentation for further details.

.. _csv-import-events:

Prepare events for CSV import
=============================

The Events CSV import can be used to supplement the types of events that
associate an actor (represented in AtoM by an :term:`authority record`) and
an information object (represented in AtoM by an :term:`archival description`.
In AtoM's data model, an :term:`archival description` is a description of a
record, understood as the documentary evidence created by an action - or event.
It is events that link actors to  descriptions - see :ref:`entity-types` for
more information, and see the section above for more information on actors and
events in the archival description CSV: :ref:`csv-descriptions-actor-columns`.
The Events CSV can be useful for adding other event types to relate actors to
descriptions, such as publication, broadcasting, editing, etc. At this time,
the events import will **only** work with archival descriptions that have been
created via import.

The event import processes 3 CSV columns: *legacyId*, *eventActorName*, and
*eventType*. The *legacyId* should be the legacy ID of the information object the
event will be associated with. The *eventActorName* and *eventType* specify the
name of the actor involved in the event and the type of event. An example CSV
template file is available in the AtoM source code
(``lib/task/import/example_events.csv``) or can be downloaded here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates#Other_CSV_templates

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the general CSV instructions
   above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Here is a basic checklist of
   things to check before importing a CSV of events:

   * The target description was imported using either the command line or the
     CSV import in the :term:`user interface` - events import will **not** work
     with descriptions created in the user interface.
   * The CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * The CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * All *legacyID* values entered correspond to the *legacyID* values of
     their corresponding archival descriptions
   * The events CSV file should be renamed to match the ``source_name`` value
     of the previous import. See above for more information,
     :ref:`csv-legacy-id-mapping`.
   * If you are referencing existing :term:`authority records <authority record>`
     already in AtoM, make sure that the name used in the *actorName* column
     matches the authorized form of name in the authority record exactly. See
     above for more information on how AtoM attempts to identify authority
     record matches: :ref:`csv-actor-matching`.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
events.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

4. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be
   discoverable via search or browse in the user interface! You will need to
   know the exact URL to reach them. To make them visible in the interface
   again, a system administrator will need to rebuild the search index. See:
   :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`.

5. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. image:: images/import-button-block.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The import button on the CSV import page

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, you can always check on the status of an
   import by reviewing the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related
   import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

6. After your import is complete, AtoM will indicate that the import has been
   initiated. A notification at the top of the page will also provide you with
   a link to the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job. Alternatively, you can click the "Back" button in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the page to return to the CSV import
   page, or navigate elsewhere in the application.

.. WARNING::

   There is a known bug in AtoM where Events that are imported via CSV will
   require further manual editing post-import to make them visible in AtoM's
   user interface. Please see note 7 in the following issue ticket for more
   information:

   * https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/9649#note-7

7. If any warnings or errors are encountered, AtoM will display them on
   :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.
   Generally, errors will cause an import to fail, while warnings will be
   logged but will allow the import to proceed anyway  - however, an 
   :term:`administrator` can configure the CSV import validation to run 
   automatically on all imports, and when this setting is set to "strict" even
   warnings will prevent a CSV import from proceeding. For more information, 
   see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validator-settings`

   Errors and warnings can occur for many reasons - please review the checklist
   :ref:`above <csv-import-events>` for suggestions on resolving
   the most common reasons that CSV imports fail. Note that validation can also
   be run independently of an import - doing so via the :term:`user interface` 
   will also generate a downloadable TXT file report with further details on 
   errors and warnings encountered, that should help you troubleshoot any 
   issues. See the :ref:`csv-validation` documentation for further details.

.. _csv-import-repositories:

Prepare archival institution records for CSV import
===================================================

You can import repositories (i.e. :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`
into AtoM as well. At this time, there is not support for importing all
repository record data fields into AtoM. However, most fields are supported.

Find the example CSV import template here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates#Other_CSV_templates

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`archival-institutions`
   * :ref:`csv-validation`

Repository CSV columns
----------------------

The ``legacyID`` column is a required field, used only internally. Add a
unique numeric value to this column. The legacyID can be used to assist in
matching multiple CSV import types. Further information is provided in the
section on legacy ID mapping above - see: :ref:`csv-legacy-id-mapping`.

The ``uploadLimit`` column allows a user to set a default upload limit for a
repository at the time of import. This value should be a number, representing
Gigabytes. For more information on the use of respository upload limits in
AtoM, see: :ref:`upload-limit`.

The ``types`` column relates to the institution type found in the Identity
:term:`information area` of the archival institution :term:`edit page`.
It is linked to the "Repository Types" :term:`taxonomy` in AtoM, which comes
pre-populated with 22 :term:`terms <term>`. New terms added via the CSV import
will be created successfully and be added to the Repository Types taxonomy.
You can add multiple terms by using the ``|`` pipe character between them,
like so:

.. code-block:: none

   Arts Organization|Community

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`institution-access-points`
   * :ref:`ISDIAH edit template <isdiah-template>`
   * :ref:`terms`

Almost all other fields are drawn directly from the archival institution edit
template in AtoM, which is based upon the International Council on Archives'
International Standard for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings
(ISDIAH). For more information on the use of each field and a link to the
related standard, see: :ref:`ISDIAH edit template <isdiah-template>`.
Generally, fields in the CSV template have been named in a fairly obvious way,
translating a simplified version of the field name in our data entry templates
into a condensed `camelCase`_. For example, ISDIAH 5.3.2, Geographical and 
cultural context (in the Description :term:`Area <information area>`) becomes 
``geoCulturalContext`` in the CSV template. Consult the 
:ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` page for further help with fields.

The ``descStatus`` and ``descDetail`` columns are both also related to
controlled term :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` in AtoM - the "Description
Statuses" and "Description Detail Levels" taxonomies respectively. The
``descStatus`` column has the following default terms available for use:

* Final
* Revised
* Draft

The ``descDetails`` column has the following default terms available for use:

* Full
* Minimal
* Partial

The ``culture`` column indicates to AtoM the language of the records being
uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code values - for 
example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian, etc. See 
Wikipedia for a full list of `ISO 639-1`_ language codes, and see the following 
link for a full list of AtoM supported languages and corresponding culture 
codes:

.. _csv-import-repos-ui:

Import new archival institutions via CSV
========================================

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"
   instructions above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Most
   importantly, make sure your:

   * CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * You have prepared your repository CSV data following the recommendations
     in the section above, :ref:`csv-import-repositories`.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

**To import new archival institutions via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: The import menu

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Archival institution". For new
   :term:`repository` records, make sure that the "Update behaviors"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Ignore matches and create new records on
   import".

.. image:: images/csv-import-page-repos.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM, set for new Archival institutions

3. AtoM can also double-check to see if a :term:`repository` with an
   authorized form of name that exactly matches your import(s) already exists,
   and skip these records during import if desired. To skip any exact matches,
   check the "Skip matched records" checkbox. AtoM will report any skipped
   rows in the console output provided on the :ref:`Job details <job-details>`
   page of the related import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more
   information.

   The console output on the Job details page will include something similar
   to the following example when a match is found and skipped:

   .. code-block:: bash

      [info] [2018-01-01 14:06:04] Job 2003115 "arFileImportJob": Row 1: Matching record found for "Example Archives", skipping.

4. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be

.. _csv-repo-update:

Update archival institutions via CSV import
===========================================

AtoM's CSV import includes the ability to use the import to update existing
archival institution in two different ways, depending on the outcome desired.
After attempting to identify existing matches, AtoM can either delete the existing
match and replace it with the matched row in the CSV import, or it can attempt
to use the matched CSV row to update the :term:`repository` record in-place
with new data.

Both options (and their limitations) will be explained further below, along
with any additional import options available when importing updates.

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`csv-repo-update-match`
* :ref:`csv-repo-delete-replace`
* :ref:`csv-repo-updates-ui`

When importing updates, AtoM will attempt to match against the existing
repository records using the authorized form of name of the repository. This
means that it is **not currently possible to use the update functionality to
change the name of your repository record**. If the authorized form of name is
edited then no match will be found.

By default, when no match is found, AtoM will proceed to create a new record
instead. If you do not want this to happen, you can click the "Skip unmatched
records" checkbox. When no matches are found with this option checked, AtoM
will skip the unmatched CSV row and report it in the console output found on
the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job - see:
:ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

.. _csv-repo-update-match:

Updating repository records in place via CSV import
---------------------------------------------------

AtoM's first option for :term:`archival institution` updates allows you to use
incoming CSV data as an update to existing :term:`repository` records.
Whenever a match is found for an existing repository (based on the authorized
form of name), AtoM will use the data in the CSV to update the related
:term:`field` in place. If a column is left blank in the updates CSV, it will
be ignored (it will not overwrite existing data by erasing it).

To import a CSV as updates to existing repository records, select the option
"Update matches ignoring blank fields in CSV" from the "Update behaviours"
:term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV import page.

.. image:: images/csv-update-match.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the Update matches option in the CSV import user
         interface

.. IMPORTANT::

   At this time, not all fields in the :term:`archival institution` record can
   be updated. Primarily, these are fields that are found in other tables in
   the AtoM database than the primary repository record table. Examples of
   fields that **cannot** be updated include:

   * Name (changing the repository name in your CSV will cause the match to
     fail)
   * Parallel form(s) of name
   * Other form(s) of name
   * Institution type
   * Locality, Region, Country, and Postal code in Contact area
   * Languages
   * Scripts
   * Status
   * Level of detail
   * Thematic area
   * Geographic subregion

   If you wish to update these fields, you might want to either make the
   changes manually, or consider the "delete and replace" method. However,
   please read the details :ref:`below <csv-repo-delete-replace>` on the
   limitations of Delete and replace as well before proceeding!

If a match is not found during the import, the default behavior is to import
the CSV row as a new record. If you are only importing updates, you can click
the checkbox for the "Skip unmatched records" if desired - AtoM will then skip
any unmatched CSV rows and report them in the console log shown on the
:ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.

See :ref:`below <csv-repo-updates-ui>` for step-by-step instructions on
importing repository updates via the user interface.

.. _csv-repo-delete-replace:

Deleting and replacing repository records via CSV import
--------------------------------------------------------

AtoM's second update option allows you to identify matched repositories during
import, and then delete the matches prior to importing the CSV data as a new
record to replace it.

Note that **only** the matched :term:`archival institution` record is deleted
during this process. Any related/linked :term:`entities <entity>` (such as an
:term:`authority record` linked as being maintained by the repository,
Thematic area or other repository :term:`access points <access point>`, and
linked :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`) **are not
automatically deleted**. If you also want these fully removed, you will have to
find them and manually delete them via the user interface after the import.

Once the original matched repository record has been deleted, the CSV
import proceeds as if the record is new. That is to say, just as AtoM does not
automatically delete entities related to the original archival institution,
it *also* not automatically re-link previously related entities.

.. WARNING::

   This means that if your :term:`archival institution` record is linked to
   descriptions, using the "Delete and replace" method will **unlink all
   descriptions** - these will not be automatically re-linked with the new
   import!

   We recommend you **only** use the "Delete and replace" method with
   repository records that are not currently linked to other entities.

To import an archival institution CSV of records as replacements for existing
repositories in AtoM, select the "Delete matches and replace with imported
records" option from the "Update behaviours" :term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV
import page.

.. image:: images/csv-update-delete.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the Delete and replace updates option in the CSV import
         user interface

If a match is not found during the import, the default behavior is to import
the CSV row as a new record. If you are only importing updates, you can click
the checkbox for the "Skip unmatched records" if desired - AtoM will then skip
any unmatched CSV rows and report them in the console log shown on the
:ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.

See :ref:`below <csv-repo-updates-ui>` for step-by-step instructions on
importing repository updates via the user interface.

.. _csv-repo-updates-ui:

Importing repository updates in the user interface
--------------------------------------------------

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"
   instructions above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Most
   importantly, make sure your:

   * CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * You have prepared your repository CSV data following the recommendations
     in the section above, :ref:`csv-import-repositories`
   * You have confirmed that the authorized form of name of the repository
     record in your CSV matches *exactly* the repository record in AtoM you
     wish to update
   * You have reviewed the sections above on each of the update behaviors and
     their limitations, and know what to expect.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
updates.

**To import a CSV file of repository updates via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. TIP::

   You can read more about each update option in the sections above:

   * :ref:`csv-repo-update-match`
   * :ref:`csv-repo-delete-replace`

4. AtoM's default behavior when it cannot find a match during an update import
   is to import the CSV row as a new record. However, if you are **only**
   importing updates and don't want to accidentally create new records when no
   match is found, you can check the "Skip unmatched records" checkbox. Any
   unmatched records will not be imported - instead, skipped records will be
   reported in the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job (see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information).

5. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be

these entities, the tool also allows the import of supplementary
data on how these entities relate to each other (See 
:ref:`csv-import-authority-record-relationships`).

You can view the example CSV files for authority records in the AtoM code (at
``lib/task/import/example/authority_records/``) or they can be downloaded
directly here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates#Authority_records

.. IMPORTANT::

   If you are attempting to import both an :term:`archival description` CSV
   and an :term:`authority record` CSV to supplement the actor data that is
   linked to your descriptions, **you must import the authority record CSV
   first**. On import, the description CSV code will look for exact matches to
   which it can link - but the authority record CSV import code does not
   currently have similar logic. If you import your authority record CSV
   template after the description CSV, you might end up creating duplicate
   authority records!

   For more information on how the archival description import manages the
   identification and linking of existing authority records, see:
   :ref:`csv-actor-matching`.

A brief explanation of the main fields in authority record CSV template is
included below.

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`csv-validation`

The ``culture`` column indicates to AtoM the language of the records being
uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code values - for 
example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian, etc. See 
Wikipedia for a full list of `ISO 639-1`_ language codes, and see the following 
link for a full list of AtoM supported languages and corresponding culture 
codes:

* https://bit.ly/AtoM-langs

.. SEEALSO::

   * CSV validation - :ref:`csv-validation-culture`

The ``typeOfEntity`` column maps to the entity type terms recommended in
ISAAR-CPF 5.1.1 Type of Entity, and maintained in AtoM in the *Actor Entity
Types* :term:`taxonomy`. This column expects one of three recommended
values - Person, Corporate body, or Family.

Almost all other fields are drawn directly from the :term:`authority record`
edit template in AtoM, which is based upon the International Council on
Archives' International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate
Bodies, Persons and Families (ISAAR-CPF). For more information on the use of
each field, see the Data entry page on the
:ref:`ISAAR-CPF template <isaar-template>` and consult the related standard.
See also: :ref:`authority-records`.

Most fields in the CSV template have been named in a fairly obvious way,
translating a simplified version of the field name in our data entry
templates into a condensed `camelCase`_. For example, ISAAR 5.2.1, Dates of 
Existence (in the ISAAR Description :term:`Area <information area>`) becomes 
``datesOfExistence`` in the CSV template. Consult the 
:ref:`ISDIAH <isaar-template>` data entry page for further help with fields.

The ``history`` column, which conforms to ISAAR 5.2.2, will appear as the
Administrative or Biographical history in any  :term:`archival description`
to which an :term:`authority record` is linked. For more information on
how AtoM manages authority records, see: :ref:`authority-records`.

The ``status`` and ``levelOfDetail`` columns are both also related to controlled
term :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` in AtoM - the "Description Statuses" and
"Description Detail Levels" taxonomies respectively. The ``status`` column has
the following default terms available for use:

* Final
* Revised
* Draft

The ``levelOfDetail`` column has the following default terms available for
use:

* Full
* Minimal
* Partial

As long as they are separated with a pipe character (``|``), multiple values 
can be included in a single column for the following multi-value fields:

* parallelFormsOfName
* standardizedFormsOfName
* otherFormsOfName
* actorOccupations
* actorOccupationNotes
* subjectAccessPoints
* placeAccessPoints

You can upload a digital object to link to the authority record (e.g. a profile
picture of the authority record's subject) by including its relative file path
on the AtoM server in the ``digitalObjectPath`` column or by including a link
to the digital object's external online location in the ``digitalObjectURI``
column.

.. TIP::

   Fields that are available in the Relationships area of the authority record
   :term:`user interface` are not available in this CSV template. However, you
   can use a separate CSV template to import these via the same user interface.
   See :ref:`csv-import-authority-record-relationships`. A system administrator
   can also import authority record relationship data with additional
   "match-and-replace" or "delete-and-replace" options via the command-line
   interface. For more information, see: :ref:`csv-authority-relationships`.


.. _csv-import-authority-records-gui:

Import new authority records via CSV
====================================

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"
   instructions :ref:`above <csv-before-you-import>`, to ensure that your
   CSV import will work. Most importantly, make sure:

   * Your CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * Your CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * If you intend to import archival descriptions as well and hope to link
     them to your authority records, make sure you are importing the authority
     records CSV **first**, that the authorized form of name used in the
     authority records CSV matches exactly the name used in the
     ``eventActors`` column of the related descriptions CSV. Be sure you also
     review how AtoM attempts to link descriptions to existing authority
     records on import - see: :ref:`csv-actor-matching`
   * You've reviewed the instructions in the section above on preparing your
     CSV file and have made sure it conforms to the recommendations. See:
     :ref:`csv-import-authority-records`.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

**To import authority records via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: The import menu

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Authority record". For new
   :term:`authority records <authority record>`, make sure that the "Update
   behaviors" :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Ignore matches and create new
   records on import".

.. image:: images/csv-import-page-actors.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM, set to import new Authority records

3. AtoM can also double-check to see if an :term:`authority record` with an
   authorized form of name that exactly matches your import(s) already exists,
   and skip these records during import if desired. To skip any exact matches,
   check the "Skip matched records" checkbox. AtoM will report any skipped
   rows in the console output provided on the :ref:`Job details <job-details>`
   page of the related import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more
   information.

   The console output on the Job details page will include something similar
   to the following example when a match is found and skipped:

   .. code-block:: bash

      [info] [2018-01-01 15:01:04] Job 2003116 "arFileImportJob": Row 1: Matching record found for "Jane Doe", skipping.

4. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be
   discoverable via search or browse in the user interface! You will need to
   know the exact URL to reach them. To make them visible in the interface
   again, a system administrator will need to rebuild the search index. See:
   :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`.

5. Click the "Browse" button to open a window on your local computer. Select
   the Authority record CSV file that you would like to import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

6. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. image:: images/import-button-block.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The import button on the CSV import page

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, you can always check on the status of an
   import by reviewing the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related
   import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

7. After your import is complete, AtoM will indicate that the import has been
   initiated. A notification at the top of the page will also provide you with
   a link to the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job. Alternatively, you can click the "Back" button in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the page to return to the CSV import
   page, or navigate elsewhere in the application.

.. image:: images/csv-import-completed.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: When a CSV import has been initiated in AtoM

8. If any warnings or errors are encountered, AtoM will display them on
   :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.
   Generally, errors will cause an import to fail, while warnings will be
   logged but will allow the import to proceed anyway  - however, an 
   :term:`administrator` can configure the CSV import validation to run 
   automatically on all imports, and when this setting is set to "strict" even
   warnings will prevent a CSV import from proceeding. For more information, 
   see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validator-settings`

   Errors and warnings can occur for many reasons - please review the checklist
   :ref:`above <csv-import-authority-records-gui>` for suggestions on resolving
   the most common reasons that CSV imports fail. Note that validation can also
   be run independently of an import - doing so via the :term:`user interface` 
   will also generate a downloadable TXT file report with further details on 
   errors and warnings encountered, that should help you troubleshoot any 
   issues. See the :ref:`csv-validation` documentation for further details.

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _csv-update-actors:

Update authority records via CSV import
=======================================

AtoM's CSV import includes the ability to use the import to update existing
authority records in two different ways, depending on the outcome desired.
After attempting to identify existing matches, AtoM can either delete the existing
match and replace it with the matched row in the CSV import, or it can attempt
to use the matched CSV row to update the :term:`authority record` in-place
with new data.

Both options (and their limitations) will be explained further below, along
with any additional import options available when importing updates.

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`csv-actors-update-fields`
* :ref:`csv-actors-match-update`
* :ref:`csv-actors-delete-replace`
* :ref:`csv-actors-update-gui`

When importing updates, AtoM will attempt to match against the existing
authority records using the authorized form of name of the existing actor
(a.k.a. authority record). This means that it is **not currently possible to
use the update functionality to change the name of your authority record**. If
the authorized form of name is edited then no match will be found.

If you have previously linked your authority records to a repository (for more
information, see: :ref:`link-repo-actor`), then it is possible to increase the
likelihood of a successful match on import by limiting the update to only
those authority records associated with a particular repository.

.. image:: images/csv-actor-skip-limit.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the Authority record update option in the CSV import
         user interface

By default, when no match is found, AtoM will proceed to create a new record
instead. If you do not want this to happen, you can click the "Skip unmatched
records" checkbox. When no matches are found with this option checked, AtoM
will skip the unmatched CSV row and report it in the console output found on
the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job - see:
:ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

.. _csv-actors-update-fields:

Authority record fields that will support update imports
--------------------------------------------------------

Currently not all fields in AtoM's :term:`authority record` metadata template
can be updated via import. Only those fields which are found in AtoM's primary
``actor`` and ``actor_i18n`` database tables will support updates in place.
Additionally, because the ``authorizedFormOfName`` field is used for matching
on import, editing this field will cause a match to fail - meaning it can't be
updated via CSV import. Below is a list of supported fields that can be updated
in place:

* typeOfEntity
* corporateBodyIdentifiers
* datesOfExistence
* history
* places
* legalStatus
* functions
* mandates
* internalStructures
* generalContext
* digitalObjectURI
* digitalObjectPath
* descriptionIdentifier
* institutionIdentifier
* rules
* status
* levelOfDetail
* revisionHistory
* sources
* maintenanceNotes

.. NOTE::

   While the ``typeOfEntity`` can be updated via CSV import, at present the
   import will only succeed when using terms that have already been added to the
   Actor Entity Types :term:`taxonomy`. If you try to add a new entity type
   via import without **first** adding it to the taxonomy, the import will fail!

There are also additional fields that are not stored in AtoM's primary
:term:`authority record` database tables that can potentially receive new
data via an update import. In these cases, existing data will **not**
be replaced - instead, the update import will append new data to the existing
resources, leaving the current data in place as well. These fields typically
relate to :term:`access point` fields (such as subjects, places, and
occupations), as well as alternative forms of name.

Below is a list of fields to which new data can be appended via an update
import - any existing data will be left in place:

* parallelFormsOfName
* standardizedFormsOfName
* otherFormsOfName
* actorOccupations
* actorOccupationNotes
* subjectAccessPoints
* placeAccessPoints

.. NOTE::

   Attempting to update the note associated with an existing actor occupation
   :term:`access point` will cause the access point to be duplicated - the
   updated note will be associated with the new duplicate term.

.. _csv-actors-match-update:

Update authority records in place via CSV import
------------------------------------------------

AtoM's first option for :term:`authority record` updates allows you to use
incoming CSV data as an update to existing authority records in place.
Whenever a match is found for an existing authority record (based on the
authorized form of name), AtoM will use the data in the CSV to update the
related :term:`field` in place. If a column is left blank in the updates CSV,
it will be ignored (it will not overwrite existing data by erasing it).

To import a CSV as updates to existing authority records, select the option
"Update matches ignoring blank fields in CSV" from the "Update behaviours"
:term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV import page.

.. image:: images/csv-update-match.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the Update matches option in the CSV import user
         interface


.. IMPORTANT::

   At this time, not all fields in the :term:`authority record` can be updated.
   Primarily, these are fields that are found in other tables in the AtoM
   database than the primary authority record table. Please see the list of
   supported fields in the :ref:`section above <csv-actors-update-fields>` for
   more information.

   If you wish to update these fields, you might want to either make the
   changes manually, or consider the "delete and replace" method. However,
   please read the details :ref:`below <csv-actors-delete-replace>` on the
   limitations of Delete and replace as well before proceeding!

See :ref:`below <csv-actors-update-gui>` for step-by-step instructions on
importing repository updates via the user interface.

.. _csv-actors-delete-replace:

Delete and replace existing authority records via CSV import
------------------------------------------------------------

AtoM's second update option allows you to identify matched authority records
during import, and then delete the matches prior to importing the CSV data as a
new record to replace it.

Note that **only** the matched :term:`authority record` is deleted during this
process. Any related/linked :term:`entities <entity>` (such as a
:term:`repository` linked as the authority record's maintainer, other
authority records linked via a relationship, Occupation
:term:`access points <access point>`, and linked
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`) **are not also
automatically deleted**. If you also want these fully removed, you will have to
find them and manually delete them via the user interface after the import.

Once the original matched authority record has been deleted, the CSV
import proceeds as if the record is new. That is to say, just as AtoM does not
automatically delete entities related to the original archival institution,
it **also** does not automatically re-link previously related entities.

.. WARNING::

   This means that if your :term:`authority record` is linked to
   descriptions, a repository, or other authority records, using the "Delete
   and replace" method will **unlink all related descriptions, repositories,
   and authority records** - these will not be automatically re-linked with
   the new import!

   We recommend you **only** use the "Delete and replace" method with
   authority records that are not currently linked to other entities.

   For more information on linking authority records, see:

   * :ref:`link-authority-to-description`
   * :ref:`link-two-authority-records`
   * :ref:`link-repo-actor`

To import an archival institution CSV of records as replacements for existing
repositories in AtoM, select the "Delete matches and replace with imported
records" option from the "Update behaviours" :term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV
import page.

importing authority record updates via the user interface.

.. _csv-actors-update-gui:

Updating authority records via import in the user interface
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"
   instructions above, to ensure that your CSV import will work. Most
   importantly, make sure your:

   * CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * You have prepared your authority record CSV data following the
     recommendations in the section above, :ref:`csv-import-authority-records`
   * You have confirmed that the authorized form of name of the authority
     record in your CSV matches *exactly* the authority record in AtoM you
     wish to update
   * You are aware that using the "Delete and replace" update option will
     remove the links between **all related entities**  (descriptions, other
     authority records, repositories, access points, etc) - though it will not
     delete these entities.
   * You have reviewed the sections above on each of the update behaviors and
     their limitations, and know what to expect.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

If you have double-checked the above, you should be ready to import your
updates.

**To import a CSV file of authority record updates via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Archival institution" .

.. image:: images/csv-import-page-actors.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM

3. Select the type of update import you want to initiate.

   To update existing authority records in place, select the option
   "Update matches ignoring blank fields in CSV" from the "Update behaviours"
   :term:`drop-down menu` on the CSV import page.

   .. image:: images/csv-update-match.*
      :align: center

   To delete existing matched authority records and replace them with the
   data in your CSV, select the "Delete matches and replace with imported
   records" option from the "Update behaviours" :term:`drop-down menu` on the
   CSV import page.

   You can read more about each update option in the sections above:

   * :ref:`csv-actors-update-fields`
   * :ref:`csv-actors-match-update`
   * :ref:`csv-actors-delete-replace`

4. AtoM's default behavior when it cannot find a match during an update import
   is to import the CSV row as a new record. However, if you are **only**
   importing updates and don't want to accidentally create new records when no
   match is found, you can check the "Skip unmatched records" checkbox. Any
   unmatched records will not be imported - instead, skipped records will be
   reported in the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job (see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information).

5. To improve the default matching behavior (based on the authorized form of
   name of the authority record), you can provide further criteria
   to help AtoM find the correct match. If you have linked your authority
   record(s) to a :term:`repository` as the maintainer, then you can limit the
   matches to either the authority records of a specific :term:`repository`.
   To learn more about linking an authority record to a repository, see:
   :ref:`link-repo-actor`.

   To limit your matches to the holdings of a specific
   :term:`archival institution`, use the :term:`drop-down menu` to select the
   name of the related repository.

   If you previously created your repository record via CSV import, it will
   sometimes not appear at first in the drop-down menu. Try to begin typing
   the first letters of the target repository name when your cursor is on the
   Limit matches drop-down to see if it appears.

6. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. _csv-import-authority-record-relationships:

Prepare authority record relationships for CSV import
=====================================================

The :term:`authority record` relationships import tool allows you to import
information that links people, families, and organizations. For more information
on how to use this functionality in the :term:`user interface`, see:
:ref:`link-two-authority-records`.

You can view the example CSV files for authority record relationships in the
AtoM code at ``lib/task/import/example/authority_records/`` or they can be
downloaded directly here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates#Authority_records

The Relationships CSV template can only be used to link existing authority
records that are already present in the AtoM database. AtoM won't create new
authority records when it encounters unknown names in the Relationship CSV
file. Therefore, :ref:`create-authority-record` first if you are planning to
import relationships for new people, families, or organizations.

.. SEEALSO::
   
   * :ref:`csv-validation`

The Relationships CSV file contains 8 columns:

* The ``subjectAuthorizedFormOfName`` is used to specify one of the actors
  included in the Authority record CSV upload. This field should match
  exactly one the "Authorized Form Of Name" field values in AtoM's existing
  authority records.
* The ``objectAuthorizedFormOfName`` is used to specify the actor with which you
  intend to create a new relationship. This field should also match
  one the "Authorized Form Of Name" field values in AtoM's existing
  authority records.
* The ``relationType`` column contains data about the type of relationship you
  are creating, and maps to ISAAR 5.3.2 Category of Relationship. The terms
  recommended in the ISAAR standard are used as defaults in the Actor Relation
  Type :term:`taxonomy` in AtoM. For more information on the distinction
  between these terms, please consult the International Council
  on Archives' ISAAR-CPF standard - specifically, section  5.3.2..

  .. image:: images/relationship-type-defaults.*
     :align: center
     :width: 85%
     :alt: An image of the Relationship type default terms

  These terms can be edited and managed in the Actor Relation Type taxonomy.
  Users can also add their own custom relationship types, e.g.
  "has students", "is a student of". For more information on managing and
  creating terms, see: :ref:`terms`; see specifically :ref:`add-converse-term`.

.. NOTE::

  You cannot add new relationTypes using the CSV template. If AtoM
  encounters a relationType in the CSV template that does not already exist
  in its database, it will output "Unknown relationship type ... skipping row"
  in its import job report.

.. IMPORTANT::

  When a ``relationType`` is added on CSV import, AtoM will automatically
  update the converse term, so only enter one row for each relationship. For
  example, if ``subjectAuthorizedFormOfName`` is "Alice", ``relationType`` is
  "is the parent of", and ``objectAuthorizedFormOfName`` is "Bob". Then upon
  import the Bob authority record will also be updated with an "is a child of"
  "Alice" relationship.

* The ``description`` field is a free-text string field that allows a user to
  provide further contextual information about the relationship.
* The ``date`` field is a free-text string field that will allow a user to
  enter a date or date range for the relationship. It allows the use of special
  characters and typographical marks to indicate approximation (e.g. [ca.
  1900]) and/or uncertainty (e.g. [199-?]). Use the ``startDate`` and
  ``endDate`` fields to enter ISO-formatted date values (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD,
  YYYY-MM, or YYYY) that correspond to the free-text *date* field. Public users
  in the interface will see the ``date`` field values when viewing
  relationships; the ``startDate`` and ``endDate`` values are not visible, and
  are used for date range searching in the application.
* The ``culture`` column indicates to AtoM the language of the records being
  uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code values -
  for example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian, etc. See
  Wikipedia for a full list of `ISO 639-1`_ language codes, and see the
  following link for a full list of AtoM supported languages and corresponding
  culture codes: https://bit.ly/AtoM-langs

Import new authority record relationships via CSV
=================================================

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"
   instructions :ref:`above <csv-before-you-import>`, to ensure that your
   CSV import will work. Most importantly, make sure:

   * Your CSV file is saved with `UTF-8`_ character encoding
   * Your CSV file uses Linux/Unix style end-of-line characters (``/n``)
   * AtoM already contains the authority records you intend to establish a
     relationship between and your CSV file matches their "Authorized Form Of
     Name" values exactly.
   * You've reviewed the instructions in the section above on preparing your
     CSV file and have made sure it conforms to the recommendations. See:
     :ref:`csv-import-authority-record-relationships`.

   AtoM also supports a CSV validation task that can be run from the
   command-line or the :term:`user interface`, that can help identify common
   errors in CSVs prior to import. For more information, see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validation-cli`

**To import authority records via the user interface:**

1. Click on the |import| :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` menu, located in
   the AtoM :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>`, and select "CSV".

.. image:: images/import-menu-csv.*
   :align: center
   :width: 30%
   :alt: The import menu

2. AtoM will redirect you to the CSV import page. Make sure that the "Type"
   :term:`drop-down menu` is set to "Authority record relationships".

.. image:: images/csv-import-page-relationships.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: The CSV import page in AtoM, set to import new Authority records 
         relationships

3. If you do not want your files indexed during the import, you can click the
   checkbox labelled "Do not index imported items." This will prevent the new
   records from automatically being added to AtoM's search index.

.. WARNING::

   If you do not index your records during import, they will not be
   discoverable via search in the user interface! To make them visible in the
   interface again, a system administrator will need to rebuild the search 
   index. See: :ref:`maintenance-populate-search-index`.

4. Click the "Browse" button to open a window on your local computer. Select
   the Authority record relationship CSV file that you would like to import.

.. image:: images/csv-import-browse.*
   :align: center
   :width: 25%
   :alt: Clicking the "Browse" button in the CSV import page

5. When you have selected the file from your device, its name will appear
   next to the "Browse" button. Click the "Import" button located in the
   :term:`button block` to begin your import.

.. image:: images/import-button-block.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The import button on the CSV import page

.. NOTE::

   Depending on the size of your CSV import, this can take some time to
   complete. Be patient! Remember, you can always check on the status of an
   import by reviewing the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related
   import job - see: :ref:`manage-jobs` for more information.

7. After your import is complete, AtoM will indicate that the import has been
   initiated. A notification at the top of the page will also provide you with
   a link to the :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import
   job. Alternatively, you can click the "Back" button in the
   :term:`button block` at the bottom of the page to return to the CSV import
   page, or navigate elsewhere in the application.

.. image:: images/csv-import-completed.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: When a CSV import has been initiated in AtoM

.. SEEALSO::

   If you want to update existing relationship records or delete and replace
   them, then an AtoM system administrator can do so using the CLI CSV import
   tool. See: :ref:`csv-authority-relationships`.

8. If any warnings or errors are encountered, AtoM will display them on
   :ref:`Job details <job-details>` page of the related import job.
   Generally, errors will cause an import to fail, while warnings will be
   logged but will allow the import to proceed anyway  - however, an 
   :term:`administrator` can configure the CSV import validation to run 
   automatically on all imports, and when this setting is set to "strict" even
   warnings will prevent a CSV import from proceeding. For more information, 
   see:

   * :ref:`csv-validation`
   * :ref:`csv-validator-settings`

   Errors and warnings can occur for many reasons - please review the checklist
   :ref:`above <csv-import-authority-record-relationships-gui>` for suggestions 
   on resolving the most common reasons that CSV imports fail. Note that 
   validation can also be run independently of an import - doing so via the 
   :term:`user interface` will also generate a downloadable TXT file report with 
   further details on errors and warnings encountered, that should help you 
   troubleshoot any issues. See the :ref:`csv-validation` documentation for 
   further details.

:ref:`Back to top <csv-import>`

.. _csv-import-accessions:

Prepare accession records for CSV import
========================================

The :term:`accession record` import tool allows you to import data about your
accessions. Additionally, when importing descriptions as well, you can use the
subsequent :term:`archival description` CSV import to create a link between
your accession records and your descriptions, by adding an ``accessionNumber``
column in the archival description CSV and populating it with the exact
accession number(s) used during your accessions data import.

Alternatively, you can use the ``qubitParentSlug`` column to link an existing
description in AtoM to new or updated accessions records via your import -
more details below.

An example CSV template file is available in the 
``lib/task/import/example/example_accessions.csv`` directory of AtoM, or it
can be downloaded here:

* https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/Resources/CSV_templates#Accessions

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`accession-records`
   * :ref:`csv-validation`

Below you'll find brief data entry guidelines for preparing a CSV file of
accessions data for import.

**Jump to:**

* :ref:`csv-accessions-parentslug`
* :ref:`csv-accessions-standard-fields`
* :ref:`csv-accession-storage`
* :ref:`csv-accession-creators`
* :ref:`csv-accession-donors`
* :ref:`csv-accession-other-notes`

.. _csv-accessions-parentslug:

Linking an imported accession to an archival description
--------------------------------------------------------

To link incoming accession records to an existing archival description, you can
add a column named  ``qubitParentSlug``. This column will behave similarly to
the ``qubitParentSlug`` column in the :term:`archival description` CSV templates
(described :ref:`above <csv-description-parent-slug>`). To link an accession
row in your CSV to an existing description in your AtoM instance, simply enter
the :term:`slug` of the target description in the ``qubitParentSlug`` column.
AtoM will locate the matching description and link the two during import,
similar to how an accession created through the user interface can be linked
to a description (see: :ref:`link-accession-description`).

.. IMPORTANT::

   While the user interface will allow an accession record to be linked to many
   archival descriptions, at this time the ``qubitParentSlug`` column in the CSV
   import template for accessions **cannot support multiple values** - attempting
   to use a pipe separator to add multiple description slugs will cause the
   import to fail. You can add only one related archival description slug to
   each row in the ``qubitParentSlug`` column - if you need to link your
   accession record to multiple descriptions, we recommend doing this manually
   via the :term:`user interface` after the import has completed.

.. _csv-accessions-standard-fields:

Standards related fields
------------------------

Most fields in the CSV template have been named in a fairly obvious way,
translating a simplified version of the field name in the AtoM
:term:`user interface` into a condensed `camelCase`_ in our data entry. For 
example, the "Immediate source of acquisition" field in the user interface is 
represented in the CSV template as the ``sourceOfAcquisition`` column.

Some fields are linked to a :term:`taxonomy` of controlled values in AtoM,
maintained as :term:`terms <term>`. These are generally represented in the
accession record :term:`edit page` in the user interface as a
:term:`drop-down menu` providing a limited list of options for a user to
select. To learn more about managing taxonomies and terms, see: :ref:`terms`.
Some of the taxonomy-related fields in the CSV template include:

* ``acquisitionType`` - listed in the user interface as "Acquisition type."
  Default values are: Deposit, Gift, Purchase, Transfer.
* ``resourceType`` - listed in the user interface as "Resource type." Default
  values are: Public transfer, Private transfer.
* ``processingStatus`` - listed in the user interface as "Processing status."
  Default values are: Complete, Incomplete, In-Progress.
* ``processingPriority`` - listed in the user interface as "Processing
  priority." Default values are: High, Medium, Low.

The ``culture`` column indicates to AtoM the language of the records being
uploaded. This column expects two-letter ISO 639-1 language code values - for 
example, "en" for English; "fr" for French, "it" for Italian, etc. See 
Wikipedia for a full list of `ISO 639-1`_ language codes, and see the following 
link for a full list of AtoM supported languages and corresponding culture 
codes:

* https://bit.ly/AtoM-langs

.. SEEALSO::

   * CSV validation - :ref:`csv-validation-culture`

.. _csv-accession-storage:

Physical object-related import columns
--------------------------------------

The ``physicalObjectName``, ``physicalObjectLocation``, and ``physicalObjectType``
columns are related to the creation of physical storage containers and locations 
related to an :term:`accession record`.

.. image:: images/csv-physical-object.*
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: example CSV physicalObject rows

For more information on working with physical storage in AtoM, see:
:ref:`physical-storage`.

These fields will also support ``|`` pipe separators to add multiple physical
storage containers per row. When piping one column, each related column must
also be piped correspondingly:

.. image:: images/csv-physical-object-piped.*
   :align: center
   :width: 75%
   :alt: example CSV physicalObject rows

.. IMPORTANT::

   If your CSV import contains physical storage information, the CSV file must
   contain information in both of the following physical object storage fields:
   ``physicalObjectName`` and ``physicalObjectLocation``. Entering information
   in ``physicalObjectName`` only will result in the creation of duplicates,
   since AtoM defaults to duplicates rather than accidentally merging separate
   records with the same location. For example, several collections may
   contain ``physicalObjectName`` Box 1, but adding ``physicalObjectLocation``
   Shelf 1 will differentiate it from Box 1 on Shelf 5.

.. _csv-accession-creators:

Creator-related import columns (actors and events)
--------------------------------------------------

The ``creators`` column can be used to add the name(s) of the :term:`creator`
of the accession materials. For now, only creation events are supported, so the
the ``eventTypes`` value should always be *Creation*. ``eventDates``,
``eventStartDates``, and ``eventEndDates`` columns can be used similarly to
those in the archival description CSV templates - The ``eventDates`` field
will map to the free-text display date field in AtoM, where users can use special
characters to express approximation, uncertainty, etc. (e.g. [190-?];
[ca. 1885]), while ``eventStartDates`` and ``eventEndDates`` should include
`ISO 8601`_ formatted date values (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, or YYYY). If there are
multiple creators/events associated with the accession, these fields can all
accept multiple values, separated using the pipe ``|`` character.

.. image:: images/csv-accession-dates.*
   :align: center
   :width: 95%
   :alt: An example of pipe-separated values in the event/creation columns

.. IMPORTANT::

   When using pipe-separated values to add multiple creators/events, values
   will be matched 1:1 across all related rows (``creators``, ``eventTypes``,
   ``eventDates``, ``eventStartDates`` and ``eventEndDates``). This means that
   even if you wish to leave the values for one creator blank (say the end
   date for creator 1 of 2), you must still pipe the field when adding the
   second creator's endDate values, or else they will be matched up with
   creator 1!

.. _csv-accession-donors:

Donor-related import columns
----------------------------

The following columns relate to donor information in the CSV import template:

* ``donorName`` 
* ``donorStreetAddress``
* ``donorCity``
* ``donorRegion``
* ``donorCountry``
* ``donorPostalCode``
* ``donorTelephone``
* ``donorFax``
* ``donorEmail``
* ``donorNote``
* ``donorContactPerson``

On import, data entry in these columns will be treated as a single donor. 
Post-import, Donor records can be managed separately from accessions in AtoM's 
:term:`user interface`. For more information on managing Donor records, see:

* :ref:`donors`

.. IMPORTANT::

   At this time Donor-related :term:`fields <field>` in the 
   :term:`accession record` CSV template **cannot be pipe separated** to 
   include more than one donor per row. At present, you can only import
   one donor per accession in your CSV import. 

   However, new donor information added to an updated CSV template with the 
   exact same accession number will be appended as a new donor - so it is 
   possible to use an update import to add an additional donor to an existing
   accession record. For more information on updating accession records via 
   CSV import, see below: :ref:`csv-accession-update-gui`.

.. _csv-accession-other-notes:

Other accession CSV data entry notes
------------------------------------

The ``acquisitionDate`` column expects date strings to be formatted according
to the `ISO 8601`_ date format standard - that is, YYYY-MM-DD. ISO 8601 
prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY]. If the date range is not 
formatted according to ISO 8601 formatting, then AtoM will use the PHP 
``date_parse`` function (which adds '1' as default value to the month and day 
if they are missing) to modify the date to a YYYY-MM-DD format.

===========================================

.. IMPORTANT::

   Before proceeding, make sure that you have reviewed the "Before you import"

.. _csv-accession-update-gui:

Update existing accessions via CSV import
=========================================

If a CSV of :term:`accession record` metadata is imported that contains rows
with the **exact same** accession number as an existing accession, it's possible
to update the existing accession record with the incoming row. Matching takes 
place exclusively against the accession number, meaning:

* It's not possible to update the accession number of an existing accession 
  record via CSV import
* Any deviation from the original accession number will result in a new 
  accession record being created. 

A CSV import can contain a mix of new accession records and rows that are 
intended to update existing accession records. 

.. _csv-accession-update-fields:

Fields that will support update imports
---------------------------------------

Currently not all fields in AtoM's :term:`accession record` metadata templates 
can be updated via import. Only those fields that are found in AtoM's primary
``accession`` and ``accession_i18n`` database tables will support updates in 
place. Below is a list of supported fields: 

* title
* acquisitionDate
* sourceOfAcquisition
* locationInformation
* acquisitionType
* resourceType
* title
* archivalHistory
* scopeAndContent
* appraisal
* physicalCondition
* receivedExtentUnits
* processingStatus
* processingPriority
* processingNotes 

There are also additional fields that are not stored in AtoM’s primary
accession record database tables that can potentially receive new data via
an update import. In these cases, existing data will **not** be replaced -
instead, the update import will append **new** data to the existing resources.
These fields typically include related :term:`entities <entity>` such as donors, 
:term:`creators <creator>` and event dates, :term:`physical storage`, as well
as alternative identifiers. 

Below is a list of fields to which new data can be appended via an update
import - any existing data will be left in place:

* alternativeIdentifiers
* alternativeIdentifierTypes
* alternativeIdentifierNotes
* physicalObjectName
* physicalObjectLocation
* physicalObjectType
* donorName 
* donorStreetAddress 
* donorCity
* donorRegion
* donorCountry
* donorPostalCode
* donorTelephone
* donorFax
* donorEmail
* donorNote
* donorContactPerson
* creators
* eventTypes
* eventDates
* eventStartDates
* eventEndDates

The process for importing updates is identical to importing a CSV of new
:term:`accession record` metadata - see :ref:`above <csv-import-accessions-gui>` 
for step-by-step instructions on how to import an accession record CSV in AtoM.
